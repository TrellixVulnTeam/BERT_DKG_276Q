Recently O

many O
approaches O

on O
the O
idea O
of O
x201C;learning O

have O
been O
proposed O
for O

them O
attempt O
to O
score O
all O
documents O
of O
different O
queries O
by O
resorting O
to O
a O

In O
this O
paper O

we O
propose O
a O
distributional O
similarity O

for O
query O

ranking O

In O
the O

framework O
, O
an O
individual O
ranking O
model O
is O
constructed O
for O
each O
training O
query O
with O
associated O
documents O
. O

When O
a O
new O
query O
is O
asked O
, O
the O
documents O
retrieved O
for O
the O
new O
query O
are O
ranked O
according O
to O
the O
scores O
determined O
by O
a O
joint O
ranking O
model O
which O
is O
combined O
from O
the O
individual O
models O
of O
similar O
training O
queries O
. O

The O
distributional O
similarity O
measure O
is O
used O
to O
calculate O
the O
similarities O
between O
queries O
. O

Experimental O
results O
show O
that O
our O
method O
is O
more O

than O

Information O
retrieval O
( O
IR O

figurative O

( O
FLP O

could O
scarcely O
be O
more O
different O
in O
their O
treatment O
of O
language O

IR O

an O

In O

There O
is O
another O

difference O
: O
IR O

practical O

in O

FLP O

neither O

This O

one O

A O
common O
problem O
of O
expert O
combination O
approaches O
in O
Information O
Retrieval O
( O
IR O
) O
is O
the O
selection O
of O
both O
, O
the O
experts O
to O
be O
combined O
and O
the O
combination O
function O
. O

In O
most O
studies O
the O
experts O
are O
selected O
from O
a O
rather O
small O
set O
of O
candidates O
using O
some O
heuristics O
. O

Thus O
, O
only O
a O
reduced O
number O
of O
possible O
combinations O
is O
considered O
and O
other O
possibly O
better O
solutions O
are O
left O
out O
. O

In O
this O
paper O
we O
propose O
the O
use O
of O
genetic O
algorithms O
to O
find O
a O
suboptimal O
combination O
of O
experts O
for O
a O
document O
collection O

Our O
system O
automatically O
determines O
both O
, O
the O
experts O
to O
be O
combined O
and O
the O
parameters O
of O
the O
combination O
function O
. O

We O
test O
and O
evaluate O
the O
approach O
on O
four O
classical O
text O
collections O
. O

The O
results O
show O
that O
the O
learnt O
combination O
strategies O
perform O
better O
than O
any O
of O
the O
individual O
methods O

Obviously O
, O
such O

, O
it O

the O

to O
enhance O
the O
effectiveness O
of O

the O

Both O
may O
be O
viewed O
as O

Our O
text O

PIRCS O
is O
based O
on O
the O
probabilistic O
model O
and O
extended O
with O
the O
concept O
of O

Components O
are O
regarded O
as O
single O

as O
an O
approximation O

Considering O

How O

one O

the O
critical O

Many O

either O

Visualization O

an O
essential O
step O
in O
the O
Information O

Indeed O
Information O
User O

are O
used O
as O
a O

Information O

Systems O
, O
and O
so O
they O
enable O

give O

Due O
to O
the O
importance O
that O
takes O
visualization O
of O

, O
many O
interfaces O
( O
which O
can O
be O

in O

) O
have O
been O
proposed O
in O
the O

However O
, O
although O
some O
evaluations O

these O

were O
proposed O
, O
they O
are O
too O
rare O
and O
not O
really O
interpretable O
( O

) O
due O
to O
the O
big O
heterogeneity O
of O

and O
due O
to O
the O
absence O
of O

. O

So O
, O
in O
this O

, O
we O
propose O
to O
define O
a O
set O

take O

In O
one O

another O
language O
translation O
is O
a O
necessary O
part O
of O
cross O

information O

systems O

Often O

this O

accomplished O
using O
machine O
translation O
systems O

However O
, O
machine O
translation O
systems O
offer O
low O
quality O

high O

This O
paper O
proposes O
a O
machine O
translation O
method O
that O
is O
low O
cost O
while O
improving O
translation O
quality O
. O

This O
is O
done O
by O
utilizing O
multiple O
web O
based O
translation O
services O
to O
negate O
the O
high O
cost O
of O
translation O
. O

A O
best O
translation O
is O
chosen O
from O
the O
candidates O
using O
either O
consensus O
translation O
selection O
or O
statistical O
analysis O
. O

Which O
to O
use O
is O
determined O
by O
a O
heuristic O
rule O
that O
takes O
into O
account O
that O
most O
web O
based O
translation O
services O
are O
of O
similar O
quality O
and O
that O
machine O
translation O
still O
produces O
relatively O
poor O
results O
. O

By O
choosing O
the O
best O
translation O
the O
method O
is O
able O
to O
increase O
translation O
quality O
over O
the O
base O

which O

One O
of O
the O
difficulties O
faced O
in O
implementing O
information O
management O
and O

systems O
is O
that O
each O
case O
seems O
to O
present O
its O

special O

As O

information O

typically O
fall O
behind O
their O

have O
many O

a O

These O

are O
intended O
to O

the O

role O

that O
functions O
such O

fill O

mathematical O
applications O
programmers O
they O
should O
make O
the O

that O

Many O

Since O

Looking O
for O
ontology O
in O

engine O

one O

find O
so O
many O
different O

that O
it O

difficult O

understand O
which O
field O

research O
the O
subject O
belongs O
to O
and O
how O
it O
can O
be O
useful O
. O

The O
term O
ontology O
is O
employed O
within O
philosophy O
, O
computer O
science O
, O
and O
information O
science O
with O
different O
meanings O
. O

To O
take O

what O

to O

one O

understand O
what O
they O

where O
they O
come O

In O

except O
for O
a O

there O
is O
no O

what O

the O

that O
it O
fosters O
among O

research O

This O

provides O
such O
a O
clarification O

We O
begin O
by O
revisiting O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O
term O
in O
its O
original O
field O
, O
philosophy O
, O
to O
reach O
its O
current O
use O

We O
advocate O
that O
ontology O
is O
a O
genuine O

subject O
of O

in O

The O

an O
information O

system O
which O
might O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
efficient O
systems O
for O
very O
large O
document O

. O

AIR O
can O
store O
the O

These O

which O
are O
based O
on O
the O

are O
fairly O

that O

The O

The O

For O

benefit O

The O
approach O

on O
collecting O
the O

to O
a O

engine O
by O
a O
user O
trying O
to O
fulfil O

This O
approach O
takes O

advantage O

links O
that O

the O
different O
search O
attempts O
that O
try O

a O
list O
of O

this O

We O
use O
the O

to O
measure O
the O

Two O

the O
effectiveness O
of O

systems O
are O
, O
respectively O
, O
the O
recall O

the O

Since O
the O
determination O
of O
these O
measures O
is O
dependent O
on O
a O
distinction O
between O
documents O
which O
are O
relevant O
on O
the O
one O
hand O

and O
documents O
which O
are O
not O
relevant O
on O
the O
other O
to O
a O

it O
has O
sometimes O
been O
claimed O
that O
an O
accurate O
, O
generally O
valid O
evaluation O
can O
not O
be O
based O
on O
recall O

precision O
. O

A O
study O
was O
made O
to O
determine O

Using O

it O
is O
found O
that O
large O

differences O
in O
the O

do O
not O
produce O
significant O

It O
thus O
appears O
that O

Our O
motivation O
as O
guest O
editors O
started O
from O
the O
observation O
that O
main O
discourses O
in O
both O
fields O
are O
different O
, O
that O
communities O
are O
only O
partly O
overlapping O
and O
from O
the O
belief O
that O
a O
knowledge O
transfer O
would O
be O
profitable O
for O
both O
sides O

were O

the O

the O

In O
Information O
Retrieval O

the O

the O
difference O
between O
what O

There O
are O
several O
reasons O

the O
existence O

those O
gaps O
such O
as O
homonymy O

it O

due O

Our O

represents O

In O
this O

we O

We O
have O
implemented O

the O

The O
result O
shows O
that O
NOVEL O

This O

The O

this O
problem O

Language O
modeling O
approaches O
to O
information O

are O
attractive O
and O

because O
they O
connect O
the O
problem O

that O
of O

, O
which O
has O
been O
studied O
extensively O
in O
other O
application O
areas O
such O
as O

The O
basic O
idea O
of O
these O
approaches O
is O
to O
estimate O
a O
language O
model O
for O
each O
document O
, O
and O
then O
rank O
documents O
by O
the O
likelihood O
of O
the O
query O
according O
to O
the O
estimated O
language O
model O
. O

A O
core O
problem O
in O
language O
model O
estimation O
is O
smoothing O
, O
which O
adjusts O
the O
maximum O
likelihood O
estimator O
so O
as O
to O
correct O
the O
inaccuracy O
due O
to O

sparseness O

In O

study O
the O
problem O
of O

smoothing O
and O
its O
influence O
on O

We O
examine O
the O

In O
probabilistic O
approaches O
to O
information O
retrieval O
, O
the O
occurrence O
of O
a O
query O

in O
a O
document O
contributes O
to O
the O
probability O

It O
is O
typically O
assumed O
that O
the O
weight O
assigned O

a O

should O
be O
based O
on O
the O
expected O

In O
this O
paper O
we O
show O
that O
the O

such O
as O

are O
expected O

By O

we O
show O
that O

We O
further O
show O
that O
by O
decreasing O

in O
the O

this O
degradation O
can O
be O
reduced O

Hence O
, O
probabilistic O

take O

not O
only O

In O
this O
paper O
we O
present O
a O
study O
on O
music O
mood O
classification O
using O
audio O
and O
lyrics O
information O
. O

The O
mood O
of O
a O
song O
is O
expressed O
by O
means O
of O
musical O
features O
but O
a O
relevant O
part O
also O
seems O
to O
be O
conveyed O
by O
the O
lyrics O
. O

We O
evaluate O
each O
factor O
independently O
and O
explore O
the O
possibility O
to O
combine O
both O
, O
using O
natural O
language O

and O

information O

techniques O
. O

We O
show O
that O
standard O
distance O

methods O
and O
latent O
semantic O
analysis O
are O
able O
to O
classify O
the O
lyrics O
significantly O
better O
than O
random O
, O
but O
the O
performance O
is O
still O
quite O
inferior O
to O
that O
of O
audio O
- O
based O
techniques O
. O

We O
then O
introduce O
a O
method O
based O
on O
differences O
between O
language O
models O
that O
gives O
performances O
closer O
to O
audio O
- O

classifiers O
. O

Moreover O
, O
integrating O
this O
in O
a O
multimodal O
system O
( O
audio+text O
) O
allows O
an O
improvement O
in O
the O
overall O
performance O
. O

We O
demonstrate O
that O
lyrics O
and O
audio O
information O
are O
complementary O
, O

can O
be O

The O

In O
this O

we O
present O
a O

GALOIS O

which O
is O
able O
to O
determine O
the O

a O

GALOIS O

each O

GALOIS O

the O

We O

that O
GALOIS O
can O

Model O

a O
useful O

because O

the O

the O

This O
task O
is O
hard O
because O
most O
of O
the O

on O
the O
Web O
today O
is O
in O
the O

not O

This O
task O
becomes O
even O
harder O
in O
a O

context O
, O
where O
web O

One O
of O
the O

is O
the O
retrieval O

a O

While O

A O

It O
also O
uses O
heuristic O
methods O
for O
the O

Our O

The O

Conjunctive O
Boolean O

are O
a O
fundamental O
operation O
in O

These O

can O
be O
reduced O
to O
the O
problem O
of O
intersecting O

where O
each O
set O
represents O
the O

one O

the O

Semantic O
query O
optimisation O
uses O
semantic O
knowledge O
to O
transform O
a O
query O
into O
another O
form O
that O
can O
be O
executed O
in O
a O
more O
efficient O
manner O
but O
still O
yields O
the O
same O
result O
as O
the O
original O

Commonly O
this O
semantic O

is O
in O
the O

generated O
either O
during O

Over O

the O

, O

very O
large O
and O
the O
number O
of O
semantically O
equivalent O
queries O
which O
may O

The O
problem O
is O
to O
identify O
a O
near O

query O
in O
a O
time O
which O
is O
minimal O
and O
also O
short O
relative O
to O
the O
overall O
query O

time O

In O
this O
paper O
we O
propose O
a O
method O
of O
measuring O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
each O
rule O
and O
present O
a O
fast O
algorithm O
which O
selects O
the O
most O
cost O
effective O
transformations O
to O
yield O
a O

Experiments O

Although O

we O

In O

will O
start O

One O
critical O
aspect O
of O

is O
indexing O

that O

the O

, O
this O
task O
was O
accomplished O
by O
creating O
a O
bibliographic O

This O
approach O
allows O
a O
reduction O
in O

space O
bounds O
, O
although O
it O
does O
not O
facilitate O
the O
user O
from O
finding O
relevant O
information O
. O

In O
effect O
, O
it O
is O
the O
combination O
of O
the O
words O
and O
their O
semantic O
implications O
that O
contain O
the O
value O
of O
these O
concepts O

which O
leads O
us O
to O
more O
sophisticated O
index O

such O

This O
information O
is O
inherent O
in O
the O

So O
, O

a O
possible O
mechanism O

extract O
a O

Previous O

We O
introduce O

In O
this O
paper O

we O
try O
to O
exploit O
the O
semantic O
richness O
of O
Arabic O

for O
Information O

The O
semantics O
of O
Arabic O
words O
may O
be O
extracted O
from O
dictionaries O
or O

, O
which O
are O
analyzed O
and O

using O
Natural O
Language O
Processing O
( O
NLP O
) O
and O
text O

tools O
. O

This O
allows O
modeling O
the O
contextual O
dependencies O
between O
words O
, O
which O
help O
identify O
the O
meaning O
of O
queries O
in O
the O
search O
process O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
queries O
are O
enriched O
by O
semantic O
knowledge O
, O
which O
enhances O
search O
performance O
. O

In O
this O
context O
, O
this O
paper O
describes O
a O

- O

approach O
for O
Arabic O
semantic O

which O
considers O

Experiments O

on O
a O

In O

Unlike O
traditional O

our O
method O
first O
construct O
a O

combine O
all O

we O

our O
algorithm O

We O
will O

In O

we O
explicitly O

; O
the O

weights O
each O

these O

. O

Empirical O
evaluation O
shows O
that O
overall O
the O
presence O
of O
negation O
harms O
retrieval O
effectiveness O
while O
family O
history O
has O
little O
effect O
. O

We O
show O
negation O
is O
best O
handled O
by O
weighting O
negated O
content O
( O
rather O
than O
the O
common O
practise O

However O
, O
we O
also O
show O
that O
many O

the O

that O

We O
investigated O
two O
strategies O
for O
improving O
Information O
Retrieval O
thanks O
to O
incoming O
and O
outgoing O
citations O
. O

We O
first O
started O
from O
settings O
that O
worked O
last O
year O
and O
established O
a O
baseline O
. O

Then O
, O
we O
tried O
to O
rerank O
this O
run O
. O

The O
incoming O
citations’ O
strategy O
was O
to O
compute O
the O
number O
of O
incoming O
citations O
in O
PubMed O
Central O
, O
and O
to O
boost O
the O
score O
of O
the O
articles O
that O
were O
the O
most O
cited O
. O

The O
outgoing O
citations’ O
strategy O
was O
to O
promote O
the O
references O
of O
the O
retrieved O
documents O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
no O

improvement O
from O

OntoQuest O

for O
previous O
decisions O
made O
in O

the O

For O

OntoQuest O
displays O
a O
list O

the O

patients O
from O
which O
the O
physician O
may O

This O
information O

is O
accomplished O
using O
ontological O

Unlike O
a O

database O

, O
an O
ontological O

To O
implement O
the O

we O
propose O
a O
method O
for O

the O
ontological O

Finally O
, O
we O
compare O
the O
OntoQuest O

We O
believe O
that O

we O

propose O
a O

a O

We O
present O
an O
approach O
to O

Context O

a O

This O

the O

Moreover O
, O
the O

It O

This O
problem O
is O
due O

the O
fact O

Fuzzy O
logic O
has O
been O
recognized O
as O
a O
useful O
approach O
for O
information O
retrieval O
. O

It O
helps O
identify O
partially O
matched O
documents O
for O
a O
given O
query O
so O
that O
ranking O
the O
relevant O
documents O
becomes O
straightforward O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
research O
on O
fuzzy O
information O
retrieval O
only O
focuses O
on O
the O
estimation O
of O
relevancy O
of O
the O
retrieved O
documents O
, O
but O
lacks O
the O
estimation O
of O
imprecise O
probability O
of O
obtaining O
such O
relevant O

This O
paper O
makes O
an O
attempt O
to O
the O
latter O

It O
extends O
the O
fuzzy O

an O

Several O
methods O
have O
been O
proposed O
to O
evaluate O
queries O
over O
a O
native O
XML O
DBMS O
, O
where O
the O
queries O
specify O
both O
path O
and O
keyword O
constraints O
. O

These O
broadly O
consist O
of O
graph O
traversal O
approaches O
, O
optimized O
with O
auxiliary O
structures O
known O
as O
structure O
indexes O
; O
and O
approaches O
based O
on O
information O
- O
retrieval O
style O
inverted O
lists O
. O

We O
propose O
a O
strategy O
that O
combines O
the O
two O
forms O
of O
auxiliary O
indexes O
, O
and O
a O
query O
evaluation O
algorithm O
for O
branching O
path O
expressions O
based O
on O
this O
strategy O
. O

Our O
technique O
is O
general O
and O
applicable O
for O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
choices O
of O
structure O
indexes O
and O
inverted O
list O
join O
algorithms O
. O

Our O
experiments O
over O
the O
Niagara O
XML O
DBMS O
show O
the O
benefit O
of O
integrating O
the O
two O
forms O
of O
indexes O
. O

We O
also O
consider O
algorithmic O
issues O
in O
evaluating O
path O
expression O
queries O
when O
the O
notion O
of O
relevance O
ranking O
is O
incorporated O
. O

By O
integrating O
the O
above O
techniques O
with O
the O
Threshold O
Algorithm O
proposed O
by O
Fagin O

we O
obtain O
