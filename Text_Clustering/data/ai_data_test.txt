In
recent
years
,
data
mining
has
been
increasingly
advocated
in
academia
and
industries
.

Its
applications
are
widespread
in
such
disciplines
as
engineering
,
marketing
,
biology
,
and
web
analysis
.

Data
mining
is
a
multidisciplinary
field
,
drawing
work
from
areas
such
as
database
technology
,
artificial
intelligence
,
machine
learning
,
neural
networks
,
statistics
,
pattern
recognition
,
knowledge
based
systems
,
knowledge
acquisition
,
information
retrieval
,
high
performance
computing
and
data
visualization
.

A
more
complete
definition
of
data
mining
is
as
follows
Data
mining
is
the
process
of
selection
,
exploration
and
modelling
of
large
quantities
of
data
to
discover
regularities
or
relations
that
are
at
first
unknown
with
the
aim
of
obtaining
clear
and
useful
results
for
the
owner
of
the
database

In
this
study
we
used
the
prediction
tools
of
PolyAnalyst
for
three
datasets’
and
compared
the
results
of
the
analysis
by
the
predictive
accuracies

Approaches
for
extracting
related
words
(
terms
)
by
co
-
occurrence
work
poorly
sometimes
.

Two
words
frequently
co
-
occurring
in
the
same
documents
are
considered
related
.

However
,
they
may
not
relate
at
all
because
they
would
have
no
common
meanings
nor
similar
semantics
.

We
address
this
problem
by
considering
the
page
designer
’s
intention
and
propose
a
new
model
to
extract
related
words
.

Our
approach
is
based
on
the
idea
that
the
web
page
designers
usually
make
the
correlative
hyperlinks
appear
in
close
zone
on
the
browser
.

We
developed
a
browser
-
based
crawler
to
collect
“
geographically
”
near
hyperlinks
,
then
by
clustering
these
hyperlinks
based
on
their
pixel
coordinates
,
we
extract
related
words
which
can
well
reflect
the
designer
’s
intention
.

Experimental
results
show
that
our
method
can
represent
the
intention
of
the
web
page
designer
in
extremely
high
precision
.

Moreover
,
the
experiments
indicate
that
our
extracting
method
can
obtain
related
words
in
a
high
average
precision
.

Purpose
To
reiterate
and
update
previous
work
in
this
area
in
the
light
of
intervening
developments
in
educational
technology
;
and
in
particular
to
demonstrate
the
value
of
distance
education
for
those
sections
of
Pakistani
society
who
are
not
well
served
by
conventional
educational
methods
.

Those
in
need
of
workplace
learning
and
similar
forms
of
educational
outreach
are
an
important
subset
of
this
population
.

Design
/
methodology
/
approach

This
is
a
historical
account
of
distance
learning
in
LIS
education
in
Pakistan
,
with
particular
reference
to
the
role
of
the
Allama
Iqbal
Open
University
(
AIOU
and
also
some
conclusions
and
pointers
for
the
future
drawing
on
developments
from
1999
to
date
.

Findings
Distance
education
has
a
unique
role
to
play
in
Pakistan
,
where
high
university
drop
-
out
rates
in
conventional
Higher
Education
,
the
need
for
outreach
to
the
remote
,
rural
poor
,
and
the
social
barriers
placed
between
women
and
participation
in
traditional
education
are
notable
features
of
social
and
educational
life
.

Research
limitations
/
implications

This
paper
presents
some
of
the
challenges
to
be
faced
by
practitioner
researchers
in
helping
further
understanding
of
how
distance
learning
and
education
can
be
offered
successfully
to
a
variety
of
sections
of
Pakistani
society
,
including
those
with
a
need
for
vocational
training
in
general
and
for
continuing
professional
development
in
the
workplace
in
particular
.

Practical
implications

The
example
chosen
of
Allama
Iqbal
Open
University
(
AIOU
)
gives
a
practical
context
to
the
paper
’s
assertions
about
the
value
and
potential
of
distance
education
in
the
developing
world
.

Originality
/
value

The
paper
gives
some
insight
into
how
‘
developed’
world
models
of
distance
education
,
delivered
via
the
new
media
,
might
offer
the
way
forward
to
existing
distance
education
activities
in
the
developing
world

Participation
in
evaluation
campaigns
for
interactive
information
retrieval
systems
has
received
variable
success
over
the
years
.

In
this
paper
we
discuss
the
large
-
scale
interactive
evaluation
of
multilingual
information
access
systems
,
as
part
of
the
CrossLanguage
Evaluation
Forum
evaluation
campaign
.

In
particular
,
we
describe
the
evaluation
planned
for
2008
which
is
based
on
interaction
with
content
from
Flickr
,
the
popular
online
photosharing
service
.

The
proposed
evaluation
seeks
to
reduce
entry
costs
,
stimulate
user
evaluation
and
encourage
greater
participation
in
the
interactive
track
of
CLEF
.

EVALUATION
OF
IR
SYSTEMS
Evaluating
the
performance
of
Information
Retrieval
(
IR
)
systems
is
an
important
part
of
the
system
development
process
from
an
engineering
point
of
view
,
and
a
crucial
part
of
the
research
process
.

It
enables
development
of
useful
and
effective
technology
,
together
with
generalisable
and
sustainable
knowledge
for
future
development
cycles
.

A
systematic
,
transparent
,
and
intuitively
valid
evaluation
process
has
been
a
defining
and
unifying
feature
of
the
information
access
research
field
during
the
past
decades
14][15][16][6][3
and
has
been
instrumental
in
ensuring
simultaneous
commercial
success
and
academic
stringency
.

We
should
stay
true
to
this
tradition
.

Traditional
Evaluation
Methodologies

The
evaluation
of
retrieval
systems
tends
to
focus
on
either
the
system
or
the
user
.

Saracevic
[
14
]
distinguishes
six
levels
of
evaluation
for
information
systems
that
include
information
retrieval
systems
1
)
at
the
engineering
level
2
)
at
the
input
level
3
)
at
the
processing
level
4
)
at
the
output
level
5
)
at
the
use
and
user
level
and
(
6
)
at
the
social
level
.

For
many
years
information
access
evaluation
has
tended
to
focus
on
the
first
three
levels
,
predominately
through
the
use
of
standardized
benchmarks
(
or
reference
collections
)
in
a
laboratory
-
style
setting
(
also
known
as
batch
-
mode
evaluation

The
Cranfield
experiments
[
5
]
were
some
of
the
first
to
develop
and
demonstrate
the
use
of
lab
-
based
evaluation
.

However
,
information
access
systems
are
most
commonly
used
interactively
,
within
a
task
and
social
context
,
and
this
drives
the
need
for
user
-
centered
evaluation
to
address
performance
at
the
latter
three
levels
(

output
,
use
and
user
,
and
social
Usercentered
evaluation
is
important
because
it
assesses
the
overall
success
of
a
retrieval
system
(
as
determined
by
end
users
of
the
systems
)
which
takes
into
account
other
factors
other
than
system
performance
,
e.g.
task
context
,
cognitive
influence
,
and
the
design
of
the
user
interface
(
see
,
e.g
8
To
enable
reproducibility
and
comparison
,
standardized
resources
for
evaluating
document
retrieval
systems
have
been
designed
and
used
(
a.k.a
.
test
collections
)
for
at
least
30
years
(
first
proposed
in
the
Cranfield
I
and
II
projects
[
4
Standardized
resources
have
been
used
in
major
information
access
evaluation
campaigns
around
the
world
such
as
TREC
,
CLEF
and
NTCIR
.

Researchers
have
recognized
the
value
of
testing
retrieval
systems
within
the
large
-
scale
setting
through
organized
and
managed
campaigns
,
undoubtedly
acting
as
a
major
influence
in
the
design
of
information
access
systems
over
the
past
ten
years
or
so
.

Not
only
have
these
events
provided
a
testbed
for
evaluation
,
but
also
an
interactive
forum
in
which
to
exchange
ideas
and
discuss
techniques
for
successful
system
and
algorithm
design
.

Although
primarily
a
testbed
for
system
-
orientated
evaluation
,
these
campaigns
(
in
particular
TREC
and
CLEF
)
have
also
included
user
-
oriented
(
or
interactive
)
evaluation
.

However
,
evaluating
interactive
information
access
systems
experimentally
is
challenging
[
2][7
The
high
effort
,
cost
,
and
overhead
involved
in
recruiting
test
subjects
,
designing
test
systems
,
and
formulating
experimental
scenarios
risks
both
delivering
unrealistic
laboratory
-
based
task
formulations
,
and
finding
general
results
drowned
in
inter
-
user
variation
.

The
low
reproducibility
of
experiments
,
failure
to
effectively
generalize
results
,
and
the
difficulty
of
comparison
between
different
systems
has
limited
the
success
of
such
initiatives
(
see
,
e.g
7][12
1.2
.

The
Challenge
for
Interactive
Evaluation

However
successful
evaluation
schemes
have
been
in
the
past
,
new
media
pose
challenges
to
content
analysis
and
to
established
target
notions
of
“
relevance
new
modes
of
communication
and
contexts
pose
challenges
to
use
cases
and
tasks
underlying
traditional
ad
-
hoc
evaluation
schemes
;
multilingual
materials
,
audience
,
and
usage
situations
pose
challenges
to
systems
and
processing
resources
.

In
addition
,
new
interactive
services
are
taken
up
by
user
communities
,
not
by
virtue
of
their
engineering
qualities
or
their
ergonomics
but
by
consumer
evaluation
based
on
social
factors
,
marketing
effectiveness
,
or
even
legal
requirements
:
offering
a
well
-
built
interface
and
providing
solid
content
is
no
guarantee
to
commercial
success
.

Evaluating
interactive
retrieval
must
make
itself
relevant
to
service
providers
by
evaluating
those
aspects
of

interaction
that
are
most
crucial
for
the
task
a
system
is
designed
for
:
if
the
system
has
no
underlying
task
model
it
must
acquire
one
to
be
valuable
.

Traditional
ad
-
hoc
evaluation
schemes
have
had
an
implicit
use
case
and
task
model
which
does
not
necessarily
carry
over
to
new
situations
.

The
next
generation
of
evaluation
methodologies
must
take
into
account
not
only
changes
in
the
underlying
content
,
but
the
varying
user
base
and
societal
and
contextual
factors
surrounding
the
usage
under
study
.

How
might
we
find
a
task
that
allows
us
to
evaluate
interactive
retrieval
,
using
multimedial
and
multilingual
data
,
possibly
not
in
a
standard
collection
,
affording
the
potential
to
model
new
settings
,
new
contexts
,
new
tasks
with
large
enough
numbers
of
users
to
transcend
inter
-
user
noise
,
with
a
minimal
amount
of
administrative
overhead
,
and
yet
provide
generalisable
,
intellectually
appealing
,
and
potentially
interesting
and
useful
results
?

EVALUATING
MULTILINGUAL
IR
Multilingual
information
retrieval
(
MLIR
)
describes
the
situation
in
which
a
user
searches
for
information
in
a
language
different
from
the
query
(
see
,
e.g
9
Multilingual
information
retreival
can
be
thought
of
as
a
combination
of
machine
translation
and
traditional
monolingual
information
retrieval
.

Most
research
has
focused
on
locating
and
exploiting
translation
resources
with
which
the
user
’s
search
requests
or
target
documents
(
or
both
)
are
translated
into
the
same
language
.

Campaigns
such
as
the
Cross
Language
Evaluation
Forum
(
CLEF

and
the
Text
REtrieval
Conference
(

TREC
2][17

have
helped
encourage
and
promote
international
research

as
well
as
create
standardised
resources
for
evaluating
multi

lingual
information
access
approaches
.

Interactive
CLEF

The
CLEF
interactive
track
(
iCLEF
)
has
been
devoted
,
since
2001
,
to
the
study
of
Cross
-
Language
Information
Retrieval
from
a
user
-
centered
perspective
.

The
aim
has
always
been
to
investigate
real
-
life
cross
-
language
searching
problems
in
a
realistic
scenario
,
and
to
obtain
indications
on
how
best
to
aid
users
in
solving
them
(
see
,
e.g
11
Multilingual
information
retrieval
is
particularly
interesting
from
an
interactive
point
of
view
,
because
the
need
for
search
assistance
is
substantially
higher
than
in
monolingual
information
retrieval
:
normally
,
the
user
can
quickly
adapt
to
the
system
’s
modus
operandi
,
but
not
to
an
unknown
target
language
.

iCLEF
experiments
have
investigated
the
problems
of
foreign
-
language
text
retrieval
,
question
answering
and
image
retrieval
,
including
aspects
such
as
query
formulation
,
translation
and
refinement
,
document
selection
and
document
examination
.

The
focus
has
always
been
on
improving
the
outcome
of
the
process
in
terms
of
a
classic
notion
of
relevance
(
documents
meeting
an
information
need
that
prompted
a
query
and
the
target
collection
(
except
for
image
search
experiments
)
has
always
consisted
of
news
texts
in
languages
foreign
to
the
user
.

Finally
,
the
task
has
always
involved
the
comparison
of
a
reference
system
with
a
contrastive
system
,
combining
users
,
topics
and
systems
with
a
Latin

Square
design
to
detect
system
effects
and
filter
out
other
effects

shows
the
progression
of
iCLEF
since
2001
.

Overall
,
participation
has
always
been
low
,
with
a
high
of
5
participating
groups
;
a
low
of
3
groups
.

Although
iCLEF
in
only
a
few
years
of
activity
has
established
the
largest
collected
body
of
knowledge
on
the
topic
of
interactive
cross
-
language
information
retrieval
,
the
experimental
setup
has
proven
limited
in
certain
respects
The
search
task
itself
is
unrealistic
:
news
collections
are
comparable
across
languages
,
and
most
of
the
pertinent
information
tends
to
be
available
in
the
user
's
native
language
.

Therefore
,
why
would
a
user
search
for
this
information
in
an
unknown
language
The
target
notion
of
“
relevance
”
does
not
cover
all
aspects
that
make
an
interactive
search
session
successful
(
e.g.
other
factors
could
include
satisfaction
of
results
,
usability
of
the
interface
itself
,
and
the
system
’s
response
time
The
Latin
-
Square
design
imposes
heavy
constraints
on
the
experiments
,
making
them
costly
and
with
a
limited
validity
(
the

of

is
necessarily
limited
,
and
statistically
significant
differences
are
hard
to

.

Moving
to
Flickr

In
order
to
overcome
these
limitations
,
the
iCLEF
track
moved
to
a
new
pilot
framework
in
2006
[
4
10
we
decided
to
use
the
publicly
available
(
and
immensely
popular
)
photo
-
sharing
service
Flickr
as
the
target
collection
.

This
is
an
inherently
multi
-
lingual
database
through
its
lively
tagging
and
commenting
features
,
and
it
has
the
potential
to
offer
a
range
of
challenging
and
realistic
multilingual
search
tasks
for
interactive
experimentation
.

Although
the
database
is
in
constant
evolution
something
which
compromises
reproducibility
the
Flickr
search
API
allows
specifying
timeframes
(
e.g.
search
images
uploaded
in
the
period
2004
-
2007
which
permits
defining
a
more
stable
dataset
for
experiments
.

The
Experience
of
iCLEF2006

Besides
moving
to
Flickr
as
the
target
database
,
in
2006
we
took
the
following
additional
decisions
:
1
.

To
lower
the
threshold
of
entry
to
the
evaluation
campaign
,
we
offered
a
standard
multi
-
lingual
interface
which
various
5
http
www.flickr.com

accessed

]
research
sites
can
use
to
explore
whatever
features
of
interaction
they
are
most
interested
in
.

The
interface
provides
a
(
baseline
)
term
translation
service
and
a
finegrained
log
of
user
actions
.

We
designed
three
different
search
tasks
:
known
-
item
search
(
find
this
image
topical
search
(
find
as
many
pictures
as
possible
around
this
topic
and
text
illustration
(
find
good
images
to
illustrate
this
text

The
illustration
task
naturally
provides
a
search
scenario
where
evaluation
has
to
go
beyond
the
traditional
notion
of
topical
relevance
.

We
did
not
impose
any
evaluation
methodology
on
the
participants
.

Being
a
novel
evaluation
scenario
,
we
wanted
to
involve
iCLEF
participants
in
the
exploration
of
novel
evaluation
methodologies
as
a
key
part
of
the
campaign
.

This
made
the
2006
a
collaborative
exercise
on
how
to
study
interactive
issues
in
cross
-
lingual
multi
-
medial
information
access
.

Whilst
we
found
enthusiastic
support
from
the
potential
participants
(
fourteen
groups
signed
up
for
the
task
only
three
sites
actually
participated
in
the
final
evaluation
(
the
three
organizing
groups
themselves
We
found
that
while
the
freedom
of
the
task
appeared
to
be
attractive
at
first
sight
,
the
entry
threshold
was
still
too
high
:
building
an
interface
and
designing
an
experiment
proved
too
costly
and
the
open
design
provided
too
little
support
for
newcomers
.

In
addition
,
we
found
that
the
submission
schedule
used
in
other
CLEF
tracks
collapses
with
iCLEF
due
to
the
inherent
time
-
consuming
nature
of
implementing
a
user
interface
and
running
interactive
experiments
.

As
in
previous
iCLEF
editions
,
there
was
valuable
knowledge
acquired
,
but
little
participation
from
the
research
community
.

It
can
be
concluded
that
,
similar
to
Interactive
TREC
,
the
interactive
CLEF
task
has
not
been
as
successful
as
the
labbased
system
-
orientated
tasks
.

Possible
reasons
for
this
include
Considering
users
is
just
not
seen
as
important
in
information
retrieval
evaluation
(
compared
to
systemoriented
evaluation

The
large
-
scale
setting
of
an
evaluation
campaign
is
simply
ill
-
suited
to
interactive
evaluation
Performing
user
experiments
is
time
-
consuming
and
difficult
and
little
gain
is
seen
for
it
(
e.g.
lack
of
generality
and
difficulty
in
comparing
results
Developing
efficient
algorithms
for
information
access
is
considered
more
important
than
user
-
orientated
issues
System
-
orientated
is
well
-
understood
;
user
-
orientated
evaluation
is
less
clear
and
requires
a
deeper
understanding
(
e.g.
in
the
experimental
design

.

Remedies
for
iCLEF2008
One
of
the
main
limitations
of
iCLEF
2006
was
that
,
although
we
moved
into
a
realistic
multilingual
search
setting
,
the
experiment
designed
still
did
not
facilitate
having
large
-
scale
user
logs
.

All
three
experiments
employed
less
than
30
users
that
had
to
be
recruited
,
trained
,
monitored
and
controlled
.

In
2008
we
decided
to
concentrate
on
collecting
user
logs
at
a
larger
scale
,
and
let
participants
concentrate
on
mining
such
logs
to
gain
more
knowledge
about
how
users
behave
when
they
need
to
search
in
unfamiliar
languages
.

To
be
able
to
harvest
a
substantially
larger
set
of
search
sessions
,
we
decided
to
implement
a
single
,
basic
multilingual
search
interface
for
Flickr
,
and
make
it
available
in
the
web
for
anyone
.

To
attract
and
specially
to
keep
potential
users
,
we
have
made
the
search
task
a
game
.

The
basic
task
is
simple
:
finding
a
given
image
(
the
user
is
shown
a
picture
)
in
Flickr
.

Finding
more
images
improves
the
user
ranking
in
a
“
Hall
of
Fame
Note
that
this
is
a
fully
multilingual
task
:
the
image
to
be
found
can
be
annotated
in
any
(
or
several
)
of
the
target
languages
,
and
the
user
does
not
know
a
priori
which
is
the
case
.

This
was
modeled
on
the
success
of
the
ESP
game
for
labeling
images
[
1
]
and
thought
to
increase
interest
in
the
task
for
both
participating
groups
and
their
subjects
.

The
entry
costs
of
iCLEF2006
were
clearly
still
too
high
,
therefore
for
2008
we
provide
groups
with
an
experimental
design
,
but
still
allow
open
extension
for
groups
to
adapt
the
design
for
their
own
investigations
.

As
the
evaluation
has
moved
to
Flickr
/
Web
users
,
participants
now
have
something
in
common
with
the
subjects
they
recruit
,
therefore
are
more
likely
to
be
a
captive
set
of
subjects
.

Finally
,
to
allow
for
the
timing
differences
of
running
an
interactive
evaluation
task
,
we
have
adjusted
the
deadlines
of
the
standard
iCLEF
calendar
,
giving
participants
more
time
to
run
and
analyse
their
experiments
.

THE
iCLEF2008
TRACK
We
now
describe
the
iCLEF
track
for
2008
in
terms
of
what
the
organizers
provide
to
participating
groups
,
and
what
the
groups
must
do
.

Data
and
Resources

The
organizers
of
iCLEF
are
providing
the
following
to
participants
in
2008
:

Task
definition

The
task
for
2008
is
known
-
item
image
retrieval
based
on
photos
from
Flickr
:
the
user
is
given
an
image
,
and
the
goal
for
them
is
to
find
the
image
again
from
Flickr
.

The
advantage
of
this
kind
of
search
task
is
that
it
has
clear
goals
for
the
user
,
it
has
a
clearly
defined
measure
of
success
(
the
image
is
either
found
or
not
)
and
whilst
searching
for
the
required
image
,
users
will
invoke
different
(
and
potentially
interesting
)
search
patterns
.

The
user
does
not
know
in
advance
in
which
languages
the
image
is
annotated
;
therefore
searching
in
multiple
languages
is
essential
to
successfully
find
the
images
.

The
task
is
organised
as
a
game
:
the
more
images
found
,
the
higher
users
(
and
user
groups
)
will
be
ranked
.

Section
3.3
describes
in
more
detail
the
selection
of
topics
and
example
images
.

Flickr

We
have
designed
and
implemented
a
multilingual
information
retrieval
interface
to
Flickr
with
the
following
functionalities
(
shown
in
Figure

Multilingual

:

between
six

(
English
,
Spanish
,

,
French
,
Dutch
and

)
using
freely
available
dictionaries
(

from
http
xdxf.revdanica.com/down
Selection
of
“

target
translations
according
to
(
i
)
presence
in
the
Flickr

terms
for
the

,
which
often
include
target
-
language
terms
because
they
co
-
occur
with
the
query
terms
in
images
annotated
in
multiple
languages
,
something
which
is
not
unusual
in
the
Flickr
database
;
and
(
ii
)
string
similarity
between
the
source
and
target
words
.

This
was
included
because
the
free
dictionaries
used
did
not
have
information
about
the
most
frequent

Enables
user
to

did

to

.

Note
that
we
did
not
intend
to
provide
the
best
possible
crosslanguage
assistance
to
search
the
Flickr
collection
.

Our
intention
was
to
provide
a
rather
standard
,
baseline
interface
where
we
can
get
information
from
users’
behavior
which
is
not
too
much
dependent
on
a
particular
interface
idiosyncrasy
.

Experiment
customization

In
addition
to
harvesting
search
logs
,
we
also
offer
this
interface
for
groups
interested
in
performing
their
own
experiments
with
selected
types
of
users
,
and
we
provide
support
for
customization
of
the
interface
.

Generation
of
search
logs
Search
logs
will
be
generated
from
the
interface
.

We
will
focus
on
two
user
groups
i
)
CLEF
participants
,
which
will
be
asked
to
play
the
Flickr
game
(
the
best
team
will
receive
an
award
at
CLEF
2008
and
(
ii
)
Flickr
/
Web
users
at
large
.

The
game
will
be
publicized
in
order
to
get
a
substantial
amount
of
usage
information
.

The
idea
of
using
CLEF
researchers
as
a
user
group
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
convenience
:
we
believe
that
few
crosslingual
information
retrieval
researchers
have
actually
experienced
cross
-
language
search
tasks
as
users
,
and
the
exercise
we
propose
might
broaden
their
vision
of
cross
-
lingual
information
retrieval
research
.

Participating
in
the
Track
Participants
in
iCLEF2008
can
essentially
do
two
tasks
:
analyse
log
files
based
on
all
participating
users
(
which
is
the
default
option
)
and
perform
their
own
interactive
experiments
with
the
interface
provided
by
the
organization
.

CLEF
individuals
will
register
in
the
interface
as
part
of
a
team
,
so
that
a
ranking
of
teams
can
be
produced
in
addition
to
a
ranking
of
individual
users
.

3.2.1
Generation
of
search
logs
Participants
can
mine
data
from
the
search
session
logs
,
for
example
looking
for
differences
in
search
behaviour
according
to
language
skills
,
or
correlations
between
search
success
and
search
strategies
.

3.2.2
Interactive
experiments
Participants
can
recruit
their
own
users
and
conduct
their
own
experiments
with
the
interface
.

For
instance
,
they
could
recruit
a
set
of
users
with
passive
language
abilities
and
another
with
active
abilities
in
certain
languages
and
,
besides
studying
the
search
logs
,
they
could
perform
observational
studies
on
how
they
search
,
conduct
interviews
,
etc
.

Topic
Selection

In
total
,
180
example
images
will
be
available
within
the
system
for
users
to
find
(
30
images
in
each
language
set
:
German
,
Spanish
,
English
,
French
,
Italian
and
Dutch
Classification
of
the
language
of
an
image
is
based
on
the
“
main
”
language
of
an
image

’s
text
and
tagset
.

Rather
than
select
images
randomly
from
Flickr
,
we
wanted
to
maintain
some
element
of
experimental
control
and
topic
variation
.

The
following
points
were
considered
during
selection
of
the
images
There
should
be
sufficient
text
/
tags
accompanying
an
image
to
facilitate
the
task
(
i.e.
we
required
“
rich
”
text
where
possible

Ideally
we
wanted
diverse
topics
in
the
test
set
and
required
roughly
equivalent
subject
/
topics
in
the
different
language
groups
,
so
the
aim
was
to
get
at
least
one
instance
of
a
subject
/
topic
group
,
for
each
of
the
language
sets
When
collecting
images
in
different
languages
but
with
the
same
subject
/
topic
,
we
aimed
to
find
images
with
a
similar
visual
perspective
The
known
item
task
must
not
be
too
hard
:
queries
for
finding
images
were
manually
recorded
and
an
independent
search
carried
out
to
check
the
images
are
not
too
hard
to
find
.

Figure
2
shows
example
images
from
the
current
set
of
topics
.

As
can
be
seen
,
these
vary
in
aspects
such
as
subject
(
topical
content
of
an
image
visual
content
,
orientation
,
activity
depicted
in
the

We
will
discuss
backgrounds
,
technology
,
and
applications
developed
in
the

Research
Group

the
talk
’s
common
thread
is
the
exploitation
of
the
web
as
a
corpus
.

Three
different
applications
will
reveal
different
rationales
and
possibilities
when
operationalizing
text
reuse
and
language
reuse
on
a
large

.

The
Netspeak

engine
reuses
the

as
a
corpus
of
writing
examples
.

It
indexes
the
web
in
the
form
of
n
-
grams
and
implements
a
highly
efficient
wildcard
search
on
the
top
.

Netspeak
supports
writers
by
retrieving
matching
n
-
grams
,
which
are
ranked
according
to
their
occurrence
frequency
and
which
allow
for
judging
a
phrase
’s
commonness
compared
to
alternatives
.

The
talk
will
highlight
some
of
Netspeak
’s
indexing
concepts

Query
segmentation
means
to
group
the
words
of
a
search
query
into
contiguous
sequences
without
changing
the
word
order
;
practically
,
it
corresponds
to
the
introduction
of
quotes
indicating
words
that
together
form
a
concept
.

Query
segmentation
is
receiving
much
attention
since
search
engines
are
trying
to
guess
concepts
in
queries
automatically
.

The
talk
will
outline
the
strategy
of
the
currently
best
performing
segmentation
approach
,
which
reuses
the

as
a
corpus

In
this
thesis
,
we
will
present
methods
for
introducing
ontologies
in
information
retrieval
.

The
main
hypothesis
is
that
the
inclusion
of
conceptual
knowledge
such
as
ontologies
in
the
information
retrieval
process
can
contribute
to
the
solution
of
major
problems
currently
found
in
information
retrieval
.

This
utilization
of
ontologies
has
a
number
of
challenges
.

Our
focus
is
on
the
use
of
similarity
measures
derived
from
the
knowledge
about
relations
between
concepts
in
ontologies
,
the
recognition
of
semantic
information
in
texts
and
the
mapping
of
this
knowledge
into
the
ontologies
in
use
,
as
well
as
how
to
fuse
together
the
ideas
of
ontological
similarity
and
ontological
indexing
into
a
realistic
information
retrieval
scenario
.

To
achieve
the
recognition
of
semantic
knowledge
in
a
text
,
shallow
natural
language
processing
is
used
during
indexing
that
reveals
knowledge
to
the
level
of
noun
phrases
.

Furthermore
,
we
briefly
cover
the
identification
of
semantic
relations
inside
and
between
noun
phrases
,
as
well
as
discuss
which
kind
of
problems
are
caused
by
an
increase
in
compoundness
with
respect
to
the
structure
of
concepts
in
the
evaluation
of
queries
.

Measuring
similarity
between
concepts
based
on
distances
in
the
structure
of
the
ontology
is
discussed
.

In
addition
,
a
shared
nodes
measure
is
introduced
and
,
based
on
a
set
of
intuitive
similarity
properties
,
compared
to
a
number
of
different
measures
.

In
this
comparison
the
shared
nodes
measure
appears
to
be
superior
,
though
more
computationally
complex
.

Some
of
the
major
problems
of
shared
nodes
which
relate
to
the
way
relations
differ
with
respect
to
the
degree
they
bring
the
concepts
they
connect
closer
are
discussed
.

A
generalized
measure
called
weighted
shared
nodes
is
introduced
to
deal
with
these
problems
.

Finally
,
the
utilization
of
concept
similarity
in
query
evaluation
is
discussed
.

A
semantic
expansion
approach
that
incorporates
concept
similarity
is
introduced
and
a
generalized
fuzzy
set
retrieval
model
that
applies
expansion
during
query
evaluation
is
presented
.

While
not
commonly
used
in
present
information
retrieval
systems
,
it
appears
that
the
fuzzy
set
model
comprises
the
flexibility
needed
when
generalizing
to
an
ontology
-
based
retrieval
model
and
,
with
the
introduction
of
a
hierarchical
fuzzy
aggregation
principle
,
compound
concepts
can
be
handled
in
a
straightforward
and
natural

The
annual
Text
Retrieval
Conference
(
TREC
)
has
become
a
major
event
in
information
retrieval
(
IR
)
research
.

Over
the
last
few
years
,
its
main
focus
has
changed
from
the
common
ad
hoc
and
routing
tasks
to
tracks
focused
on
special
interests
,
such
as
cross
-
language
retrieval
,
question
answering
,
and
large
database
/
Web
retrieval
.

In
each
of
the
tracks
,
a
common
task
and
test
collection
is
developed
each
year
for
all
participating
groups
to
undertake
.

One
problem
the
tracks
have
is
a
paucity
of
face
-
to
-
face
meetings
,
since
the
only
certain
time
each
track
actually
meets
is
at
the
annual
TREC
meeting
.

For
many
tracks
,
this
time
is
too
early
to
work
out
all
the
details
of
the
coming
yearg
track
,
and
most
additional

is

Advances
in
digital
capture
and
storage
technologies
mean
that
it
is
now
possible
to
capture
and
store
one
’s
entire
life
experiences
in
a
Human
Digital
Memory
(
HDM

However
,
these
vast
personal
archives
are
of
little
benefit
if
an
individual
can
not
locate
and
retrieve
significant
items
from
them
.

While
potentially
offering
exciting
opportunities
to
support
a
user
in
their
activities
by
providing
access
to
information
stored
from
previous
experiences
,
we
believe
that
the
features
of
HDM
datasets
present
new
research
challenges
for
information
retrieval
which
must
be
addressed
if
these
possibilities
are
to
be
realised
.

Specifically
we
postulate
that
effective
retrieval
from
HDMs
must
exploit
the
rich
sources
of
context
data
which
can
be
captured
and
associated
with
items
stored
within
them
.

User
’s
memories
of
experiences
stored
within
their
memory
archive
will
often
be
linked
to
these
context
features
.

We
suggest
how
such
contextual
metadata
can
be
exploited
within
the
retrieval
process
.

In
this
paper
we
investigate
how
retrieving
information
can
be
improved
through
task
related
indexing
of
documents
based
on
ontologies
.

Different
index
types
,
varying
from
content­based
keywords
to
structured
task­based
indexing
ontologies
are
compared
in
an
experiment
that
simulates
the
task
of
creating
instructional
material
from
a
database
of
source
material
.

To
be
able
to
judge
the
added
value
of
task
and
ontology
related
indexes
,
traditional
information
retrieval
performance
measures
are
extended
with
new
measures
reflecting
the
quality
of
the
material
produced
with
the
retrieved
information
.

The
results
of
the
experiment
show
that
a
structured
task­based
indexing
ontology
improves
the
quality
of
the
product
created
from
retrieved
material
only
to
some
extent
,
but
that
it
certainly
improves
the
efficiency
and
effectiveness
of
search
and
retrieval
and
precision
of
use
.

This

proposes
an
efficient
client

-
based
query
translation
approach
to
allowing
more
feasible
implementation
of
cross

language
information
retrieval
(
CLIR
)
services
in
digital

(
DL

systems
.

A
centralized
query
translation
server
is
constructed
to
process
the
translation
requests
of
cross

lingual
queries
from
connected
DL
systems
.

To
extract
translations
not
covered
by
standard
dictionaries
,
the
server
is
developed
based
on
a
novel
integration
of
dictionary
resources
and
Web
mining
methods
,
including
anchor

and
search
-
result
methods
,
which
exploit
huge
amounts
of
multilingual
and
wide

scoped
Web
resources
as
live
bilingual
corpora
to
alleviate
translation
difficulties
,
and
have
been
proven
particularly
effective
for
extracting
multilingual
translation
equivalents
of
query
terms
containing
proper
names
or
new
terminologies
.

The
proposed
approach
was
implemented
in
a

engine
called
LiveTrans

which
has
been
shown
its
feasibility
in
providing
efficient

Exploration
of

Also
a

introduced
and
used

The

presents
the
CROSSMARC
approach
for
the
complex
task
of
identification
of
interesting
web
sites
and
web
pages
and
the
extraction
of
information
from
them
.

This
task
is
hard
because
most
of
the
information
on
the
Web
today
is
in
the
form
of
HTML
documents
,
which
are
designed
for
presentation
purposes
and
not
for
automatic
extraction
systems
.

This
task
becomes
even
harder
in
a
multilingual
context
,
where
web
pages
in
different
languages
need
to
be
considered
.

CROSSMARC
approach
focuses
on
the
easy
customization
of
web
information
retrieval
and
extraction
technology
to
new
domains
and
languages
.

This
is
achieved
by
adopting
and
implementing
an
open
,
multi
-
lingual
and
multi
-
agent
architecture
that
integrates
the
CROSSMARC
components
into
a
web

as
well
as
by
providing
an

that

ABSTRACT
The
Information
Systems
,
Databases
are
vital
and
critical
in
the
arena
of
Business
,
Enterprise
,
Governance
etc
for
the
decision
making
.

Further
,
the
Information
Systems
are
designed
to
reach
maximum
number
of
people
for
interaction
with
system
.

This
intent
of
system
usage
appears
to
be
resourceful
but
the
identification
of
reliable
users
of
system
has
challenged
the
technocrats
Most
of
the
applications
uses
relational
data
base
system
(
RDBMS
)
for
the
database
support
but
with
intelligent
exploitation
of
vulnerability
in
Structured
Query
Language
(
SQL
)
of
RDBMS
,
the
dishonest
people
are
interested
in
manipulation
or
processing
of
the
data
for
business
value
reduction
or
damage
This
paper
attempts
to
endow
with
security
to
a
relational
database
system
by
the
inclusion
of
newly
designed
semiotic
to
keyword
SECURE
into
a

.

Then
the
semiotic
is
articulated
in

We
introduce
a
method
for
using
reductions
to
construct
integrality
gaps
for
semidefinite
programs
(
SDPs
These
imply
new
limitations
on
the
sum
-
of
-
squares
(
SoS
)
hierarchy
in
two
settings
where
previously
no
ω(1)-round
integrality
gaps
were
known
:
1
.

The
2
4
norm
of
a
matrix
,
or
equivalently
,
the
set
of
separable
(
i.e.
unentangled
)
quantum
states
.

The
set
of
quantum
correlations
;
i.e.
conditional
probability
distributions
achievable
with
local
measurements
on
a
shared
entangled
state
.

Integrality
gaps
for
the
2→
4
norm
had
previously
been
sought
due
to
its
connection
to
SmallSet
Expansion
(
SSE
)
and
Unique
Games
(
UG
while
integrality
gaps
for
separable
states
have
long
been
studied
in
quantum
information
theory
.

In
each
case
,
no
-
go
theorems
were
previously
known
based
on
computational
assumptions
such
as
the
Exponential
Time
Hypothesis
(
ETH
)
which
asserts
that
3-SAT
requires
exponential
time
to
solve
.

Our
unconditional
results
achieve
the
same
parameters
as
the
previous
ETH
-
based
results
for
separable
states
and
the
2
4
norm
,
and
achieve
weaker
parameters
for
quantum
correlations
.

In
some
cases
we
can
make
use
of
the
framework
of
Lee
-
Raghavendra
-
Steurer
(
LRS
)
to
establish
integrality
gaps
for
any
SDP
,
not
only
the
SoS
hierarchy
.

To
the
authors’
knowledge
,
this
provides
the
first
extension
of
LRS
to
problems
over
non
-
boolean
domains
.

These
results
can
be
viewed
as
limitations
on
various
ideas
from
quantum
information
(
including
the
monogamy
principle
,
the
PPT
test
,
Tsirelson
-
type
inequalities
)
for
understanding
entanglement
.

Many
of
these
ideas
have
been
formalized
into
SDP
hierarchies

Our
information
retrieval
system
takes
advantage
of
numerous
characteristics
of
information
and
uses
numerous
sophisticated
techniques
.

It
uses
Robertson
’s
2-Poisson
model
and
Rocchio
’s
formula
,
both
of
which
are
known
to
be
effective
.

Characteristics
of
newspapers
such
as
locational
information
are
used
.

We
present
our
application
of
Fujita
’s
method
,
where
longer
terms
are
used
in
retrieval
by
the
system
but
de
-
emphasized
relative
to
the
emphasis
on
the
shortest
terms
.

This
allows
us
to
use
both
compound
and
single
-
word
terms
.

The
statistical
test
used
in
expanding
queries
through
an
automatic
feedback
process
is
described
.

The
method
gives
us
terms
that
have
been
statistically
shown
to
be
related
to
the
top
-
ranked
documents
obtained
in
the
first
retrieval
.

We
also
use
a
numerical
term
,
QIDF
,
which
is
an
IDF
term
for
queries
.

QIDF
decreases
the
scores
for
stop
words
that
occur
in
many
queries
.

It
can
be
very
useful
for
foreign
languages
for
which
we
can
not
determine
stop
words
.

We
also
use
web
-
based
unknown
word
translation
for
bilingual
information
retrieval
.

We
participated
in
two
monolingual
information
retrieval
tasks
(
Korean
and
Japanese

and
five
bilingual

A
Private
Information
Retrieval
(
PIR
)
scheme
is
a
protocol
in
which
a
user
retrieves
a
record
out
of
N
from
a
replicated
database
,
while
hiding
from
the
database
which
record
has
been
retrieved
,
as
long
as
the
different
replicas
do
not
collude
.

A
specially
interesting
sub
-
field
of
research
,
called
singledatabase
PIR
,
deals
with
the
schemes
that
allow
a
user
to
retrieve
privately
an
element
of
a
non
-
replicated
database
.

In
these
schemes
,
user
privacy
is
related
to
the
intractability
of
a
mathematical
problem
,
instead
of
based
on
the
assumption
that
different
replicas
exist
and
do
not
collude
against
their
users
.

Single
-
database
and
replicated
-
database
PIR
schemes
have
generated
an
enormous
amount
of
research
in
the
privacy
protection
field
during
the
last
two
decades
.

However
,
many
scientists
believe
,
specially
for
single
-
database
PIR
schemes
,
that
these
are
theoretical
tools
unusable
in
almost
any
situation
.

It
is
true
that
these
schemes
usually
require
the
database
to
use
an
enormous
amount
of
computational
power
,
but
considering
the
huge
amount
of
applications
these
protocols
have
,
it
is
important
to
evaluate
precisely
their
usability
.

We
present
in
this
article
an
overview
of
the
current
singledatabase

PIR
schemes
through
the
innovations
they
have
brought
to
this
field
of
research
.

This
gives
a
unified
view
of
the
evolution
since
the
first
of
these
schemes
was
presented
by
Kushilevitz
and
Ostrovsky
in
1997
and
up
to
the
latest
trends
in
single
-
database
PIR
research
such
as
trusted
hardware
usage
,
and
noise
-
based
schemes
.

Then
,
we
compare
the
most
representative
of
these
schemes
with
a
single
set
of
communication
and
computational
performance
measures
.

We
highlight
that
practical
usability
of
PIR
schemes
is
not
as
dependent
on
communication
performance
as
the
literature
suggests
,
and
that
a
trade
-
off
between
communication
and
computation
leads
to
much
more
versatile
schemes
.

Canonical
Information
Retrieval
systems
perform
a
ranked
keyword
search
strategy
:
Given
a
user
’s
one
-
off
information
need
(
query
a
list
of
documents
,
ordered
by
relevance
,
is
returned
.

The
main
limitation
of
that
“
one
fits
all
”
approach
is
that
long
-
term
user
interests
are
neglected
in
the
search
process
,
implicitly
assuming
that
they
are
completely
independent
of
the
user
query
.

Actually
,
there
are
information
access
scenarios
that
can
not
be
solved
through
a
straightforward
matching
of
queries
and
documents
,
since
other
elements
influence
the
relevance
of
the
retrieved
results
.

In
these
scenarios
,
a
smart
search
engine
could
exploit
information
about
topics
of
interest
,
stored
in
the
user
profile
,
to
automatically
tailor
ranking
functions
to
a
particular
user
.

The
main
contribution
of
this
paper
is
an
extension
of
the
vector
space
retrieval
model
in
which
user
profiles
learned
by
a
content
-
based
recommender
system
are
taken
into
account
to
modify
the
ranking
of
search
results
.

Experimental
results
in
a

scenario
show
how
promising
is
the
approach

One
of
the
challenges
in
cross
lingual
information
retrieval
is
the
retrieval
of
relevant
information
for
a
query
expressed
in
a
native
language
.

While
retrieval
of
relevant
documents
is
slightly
easier
,
analyzing
the
relevance
of
the
retrieved
documents
and
the
presentation
of
the
results
to
the
users
are
non
-
trivial
tasks
.

A
method
for
information
retrieval
for
a
query
expressed
in
a
native
language
is
presented
in
this
paper
.

It
uses
insights
from
data
mining
and
intelligent
search
for
formulating
the
query
and
parsing
the
results
.

It
also
uses
heuristic
methods
for
the
categorization
of
documents
in
terms
of
relevance
.

Our
approach
compliments
the
search
engine
’s
inbuilt
methods
for
identifying
and
displaying
the
results
of
queries
.

A
prototype
has
been
developed
for
analyzing
Tamil
-
English
corpora
.

The
initial
results
have
shown
that
this
approach
is
suitable
for
on

The
increasing
diversity
of
languages
used
on
the
web
introduces
a
new
level
of
complexity
to
Information
Retrieval
(
IR
)
systems
.

We
can
no
longer
assume
that
textual
content
is
written
in
one
language
or
even
the
same
language
family
.

In
this
paper
,
we
demonstrate
how
to
build
massive
multilingual
annotators
with
minimal
human
expertise
and
intervention
.

We
describe
a
system
that
builds
Named
Entity
Recognition
(
NER
)
annotators
for
40
major
languages
using
Wikipedia
and
Freebase
.

Our
approach
does
not
require
NER
human
annotated
datasets
or
language
specific
resources
like
treebanks
,
parallel
corpora
,
and
orthographic
rules
.

The
novelty
of
approach
lies
therein
using
only
language
agnostic
techniques
,
while
achieving
competitive
performance
.

Our
method
learns
distributed
word
representations
(
word
embeddings
)
which
encode
semantic
and
syntactic
features
of
words
in
each
language
.

Then
,
we
automatically
generate
datasets
from
Wikipedia
link
structure
and
Freebase
attributes
.

Finally
,
we
apply
two
preprocessing
stages
(
oversampling
and
exact
surface
form
matching
)
which
do
not
require
any
linguistic
expertise
.

Our
evaluation
is
two
fold
:
First
,
we
demonstrate
the
system
performance
on
human
annotated
datasets
.

Second
,
for
languages
where
no
gold
-
standard
benchmarks
are
available
,
we
propose
a
new
method
,

Background
:
With
an
increase
in
the
number
of
disciplines
contributing
to
health
literacy
scholarship
,
we
sought
to
explore
the
nature
of
interdisciplinary
research
in
the
field
.

This
study
sought
to
describe
disciplines
that
contribute
to
health
literacy
research
and
to
quantify
how
disciplines
draw
from
and
contribute
to
an
interdisciplinary
evidence
base
,
as
measured
by
citation
networks
.

Methods
:
We
conducted
a
literature
search
for
health
literacy
articles
published
between
1991
and
2015
in
four
bibliographic
databases
,
producing
6,229
unique
bibliographic
records
.

We
employed
a
scientometric
tool
(
CiteSpace
[
Version
4.4.R1
to
quantify
patterns
in
published
health
literacy
research
,
including
a
visual
path
from
cited
discipline
domains
to

domains
.

Key
Results
:

The
number
of
health
literacy
publications
increased
each
year
between
1991
and
2015
.

Two
spikes
,
in
2008
and
2013
,
correspond
to
the
introduction
of
additional
subject
categories
,
including
information
science
and
communication
.

Two
journals
have
been
cited
more
than
2,000
times
—
the
Journal
of
General

Medicine
(

)
and
Patient

whereas
articles
from
the
domain
“

,
health
”
cite
from
two
separate
domains
(
health
,
nursing
,
medicine
and
psychology
,
education
,
social
Conclusions
:

Recent
spikes
in
the
number
of
published
health
literacy
articles
have
been
spurred
by
a
greater
diversity
of
disciplines
contributing
to
the
evidence
base
.

However
,
despite
the
diversity
of
disciplines
,
citation
paths
indicate
the
presence
of
a
few
,
self
-
contained
disciplines
contributing
to
most
of
the
literature
,
suggesting
a
lack
of
interdisciplinary

complex
and
evolving
challenges
in
the

Summary

:
The
addition
of
diverse
disciplines
conducting
health
literacy
scholarship
has
spurred
recent
spikes
in
the
number
of
publications
.

However
,
citation
paths
suggest
that
interdisciplinary
research
can
be
strengthened
.

Findings
directly
align
with
the
increasing
emphasis
on
team
science
,
and
support
opportunities
and
resources
that
incentivize
interdisciplinary
health
literacy
research
.

The
study
of
health
literacy
has
significantly
expanded
over
the
past
decade
.

It
represents
a
dynamic
area
of
inquiry
that
extends
to
multiple
disciplines
.

Health
literacy
emerged
as
a
derivative
of
literacy
and
early
definitions
focused
on
the
ability
to
read
and
understand
medical
instructions
and
health
care
information
(
Parker
,
Baker
,
Williams

This
early
work
led
to
a
body
of
research
demonstrating
that
people
with
low
health
literacy
generally
had
poorer
health
outcomes
,
including
lower
levels
of

and

In
the
information
retrieval
process
,
functions
that
rank
documents
according
to
their
estimated
relevance
to
a
query
typically
regard
query
terms
as
being
independent
.

However
,
it
is
often
the
joint
presence
of
query
terms
that
is
of
interest
to
the
user
,
which
is
overlooked
when
matching
independent
terms
.

One
feature
that
can
be
used
to
express
the
relatedness
of
co
-
occurring
terms
is
their
proximity
in
text
.

In
past
research
,
models
that
are
trained
on
the
proximity
information
in
a
collection
have
performed
better
than
models
that
are
not
estimated
on
data
.

We
analyzed
how
co
-
occurring
query
terms
can
be
used
to
estimate
the
relevance
of
documents
based
on
their
distance
in
text
,
which
is
used
to
extend
a
unigram
ranking
function
with
a
proximity
model
that
accumulates
the
scores
of
all
occurring
term
combinations
.

This
proximity
model
is
more
practical
than
existing
models
,
since
it
does
not
require
any
co
-
occurrence
statistics
,
it
obviates
the
need
to
tune
additional
parameters
,
and
has
a
retrieval
speed
close
to
competing
models
.

We
show
that
this
approach
is
more
robust
than
existing
models
,
on
both
Web
and
newswire
corpora
,
and
on
average
performs
equal
or
better
than
existing
proximity
models
across
collections

To
facilitate
the
search
for
relevant
information
across
a
setof
online
distributed
collections
,
a
federated
information
retrieval
system
typically
represents
each
collection
,
centrally
,
by
a
set
of
vocabularies
or
sampled
documents
.

Accurate
retrieval
is
therefore
related
to
how
precise
each
representation
reflects
the
underlying
content
stored
in
that
collection
.

As
collections
evolve
over
time
,
collection
representations
should
also
be
updated
to
reflect
any
change
,
however
,
a
current
solution
has
not
yet
been
proposed
.

In
this
study
we
examine
both
the
implications
of
out
-
of
-
date
representation
sets
on
retrieval
accuracy
,
as
well
as
proposing
three
different
policies
for
managing
necessary
updates
.

Each
policyis
evaluated
on
a
testbed
of
forty
-
four
dynamic
collections
over
an
eight
-
week
period
.

Our
findings
show
that
out
-
of
-
date
representations
significantly
degrade
performance
overtime
,
however
,
adopting
a
suitable
update
policy
can
minimise
this
problem

Information
Retrieval
(
IR
broadly
intended
as
the
discipline
concerned
with
computerized
access
to
data
with
poorly
understood
semantics
,
has
grown
in
the
last
decade
from
a
relatively
small
academic
specialty
to
a
richly
articulated
field
at
the
forefront
of
computer
science
.

The
most
conspicuous
trend
of
the
'
90s
within
IR
,
aside
from
the
emergence
of
Web
search
engines
,
has
been
the
proliferation
of
a
number
of
subtasks
that
depart
from
the
mainstream
text
search
paradigm
,
and
tackle
information
access
and
use
from
a
larger
perspective
.

Tasks
such
as
automated
text
categorization
,
information
filtering
(
or
routing
information
extraction
text
mining
,
question
answering
,
text
summarization
,
and
topic
(
or
event
)
detection
and
tracking
,
are
no
longer
the
next
frontier
of
IR
,
but
have
become
its
pulsating
heart
.

Central
to
the
development
of
these
novel
(
or
relatively
novel
)
IR
tasks
is
the
application
of
techniques
from
machine
learning
(

The
key
idea
is
that
there
is
a
lot
of
knowledge
out
there
that
can
be
brought
to
bear
on
information
access
tasks
,
but
this
knowledge
hardly
ever
comes
in
the
form
of
a
systematized
knowledge
base
,
since
such
knowledge
bases
have
to
be
manually
built
,
and
for
most
applications
are
thus
unavailable
or
too
costly
to
develop
.

Rather
,
knowledge
manifests
itself
in
the
data
,
and
has
to
be
extracted
from
it
;
the
shift
of
focus
is
thus
from
an
intensional
to
an
extensional
notion
of
semantics
,
whereby
the
semantics
of
a
concept
is
no
more
a
declarative
description
of
it
or
a
set
of
rules
for
recognizing
its
instances
,
but
is
the
set
of
contexts
(
e.g.
documents
)
in
which
it
is
instantiated
.

In
this
setting
,
the
goal
of
ML
techniques
is
to
help
structure
data
in
various
respects
.

Probably
the
best
known
among
the
disciplines
that
lie
at
the
crossroads
of
IR
and
ML
is
Automated
Text
Categorization
(
ATC
the
task
of
building
software
tools
capable
of
classifying
text
documents
under
one
or
more
of
a
set
of
predefined
categories
or
subject
codes
.

ATC
dates
back
to
the
early
'
60s
,
when
it
was
mainly
viewed
as
a
means
to
alleviate
the
task
of
indexing
scientific
literature
by
controlled
vocabulary
terms
.

However
,
it
was
only
in
the
early
'
90s
that
ATC
fully
flourished
,
under
the
pressure
caused
by
the
increased
availability
of
ever
larger
numbers
of
text
documents
in
digital
form
and
by
the
ensuing
need

A
wide
range
of
text

based
artifacts
contribute
to
software

etc
Traceability
Link
Recovery
(
TLR
)
is
the
software
task
in
which
relevant
documents
in
these
various
sets
are
linked
to
one
another
,
uncovering
information
about
the
project
that
is
not
available
when
considering
only
the
documents
themselves
.

This
information
is
helpful
for
enabling
other
tasks
such
as
improving
test
coverage
,
impact
analysis
,
and
ensuring
that
system
or
regulatory
requirements
are
met
.

However
,
while
traceability
links
are
useful
,
performing
TLR
manually
is
time
consuming
and
fraught
with
error
.

Previous
work
has
applied
Information
Retrieval
(
IR
)
and
other
techniques
to
reduce
the
human
effort
involved
;
however
,
that
effort
remains
significant
.

In
this
research
we
seek
to
take
the
next
step
in
reducing
it
by
using
machine
learning
(
ML
)
classification
models
to
predict
whether
a
candidate
link
is
valid
or
invalid
without
human
oversight
.

Preliminary
results
show
that
this
approach
has
promise
for
accurately
recommending
valid
links
;
however
,
there
are
several
challenges
that
still
must
be
addressed
in
order
to
achieve
a
technique
with
high
enough
performance
to
consider
it
a
viable
,
completely
automated

Many
tasks
in
computer
vision
,
such
as
action
classification
and
object
detection
,
require
us
to
rank
a
set
of
samples
according
to
their
relevance
to
a
particular
visual
category
.

The
performance
of
such
tasks
is
often
measured
in
terms
of
the
average
precision
(
AP

Yet
it
is
common
practice
to
employ
the
support
vector
machine
(
SVM
)
classifier
,
which
optimizes
a
surrogate
0
-
1
loss
.

The
popularity
of
SVM
can
be
attributed
to
its
empirical
performance
.

Specifically
,
in
fully
supervised
settings
,
SVM
tends
to
provide
similar
accuracy
to
AP
-
SVM
,
which
directly
optimizes
an
AP
-
based
loss
.

However
,
we
hypothesize
that
in
the
significantly
more
challenging
and
practically
useful
setting
of
weakly
supervised
learning
,
it
becomes
crucial
to
optimize
the
right
accuracy
measure
.

In
order
to
test
this
hypothesis
,
we
propose
a
novel
latent
AP
-
SVM
that
minimizes
a
carefully
designed
upper
bound
on
the
AP
-
based
loss
function
over
weakly
supervised
samples
.

Using
publicly
available
datasets
,
we
demonstrate
the
advantage
of
our
approach
over
standard
loss
-
based
learning
frameworks
on
three
challenging
problems
:
action
classification
,
character
recognition
and
object
detection

In
this
article
,
a
formalisation
of
index
expressions
is
presented
.

Index
expressions
are
more
expressive
than
keywords
while
maintaining
a
comprehensible
complexity
.

Index
expressions
are
well
-
known
in
Information
Retrieval
(
IR
where
they
are
used
for
characterising
document
contents
,
formulation
of
user
interests
,
and
matching
mechanisms
.

In
addition
,
index
expressions
have
found
both
practical
and
theoretical
applicability
in
2-level
hypermedia
systems
for
IR
.

In
these
applications
,
properties
of
(
the
structure
of
)
index
expressions
are
heavily
relied
upon
.

However
,
the
presupposed
mathematical
formalisation
of
index
expressions
and
their
properties
still
lacks
.

Our
formalism
is
based
on
the
structural
notation
of
index
expressions
.

It
is
complete
in
the
sense
that
several
notions
of
subexpressions
and
defoliation
of
index
expressions
are
also
formalised
.

Defoliation
,
which
plays
an
important
role
in
defining
properties
of
index
expressions
,
is
provided
as
a
recursively

Every
query
issued
by
a
user
to
find
some
relevant
information
,
contains
the
semantic
and
its
associated
contexts
,
but
,
indentifying
and
conveying
these
semantic
and
context
(
present
in
the
query
)
to
MIR
system
is
a
major
challenge
and
still
needs
to
be
tackled
effectively
.

Thus
,
exploiting
the
plausibility
of
context
associated
with
semantic
concept
for
the
purpose
of
enhancement
in
retrieval
of
the
possible
relevant

,
we

to
learn

and

can
be
purposefully

would

Bibster
exploits

,
query

and

.

While
the
original
Bibster
system
assumed
a

ontology
,
we
here
describe
extensions
to
the
Bibster
system
,
that
allow
to
learn
personalized
ontologies
from
the
local
bibliographic
metadata
.

These
personal
ontologies
can
not
only
be
used
for
subsequently
classifying
the
bibliographic
metadata
,
but
also
for
supporting
an
improved

Similarity
search
has
been
widely
used
in
many
applications
such
as
information
retrieval
,
image
data
analysis
,
and
time
-
series
matching
.

Previous
work
on
similarity
search
usually
consider
the
search
problem
in
the
full
space
.

In
this
paper
,
however
,
we
tackle
a
problem
,
subspace
similarity
search
,
which
finds
all
data
objects
that
match
with
a
query
object
in
the
subspace
instead
of
the
original
full
space
.

In
particular
,
the
query
object
can
specify
arbitrary
subspace
with
arbitrary
number
of
dimensions
.

Due
to
the
exponential
number
of
possible
subspaces
specified
by
users
,
we
introduce
an
efficient
and
effective
pruning
technique
,
which
assigns
scores
to
data
objects
with
respect
to
pivots
and
prunes
candidates
via
scores
.

We
propose
an
effective
multipivot
-
based
method
to
preprocess
data
objects
by
selecting
appropriate
pivots
,
where
the
entire
procedure
is
guided
by
a
formal
cost
model
,
such
that
the
pruning
power
is
maximized
.

Then
,
scores
of
each
data
object
are
organized
in
sorted
lists
to
facilitate
an
efficient
subspace
similarity
search
.

Furthermore
,
many
real
-
world
application
data
such
as
image
databases
,
time
-
series
data
,
and
sensory
data
often
contain
noises
,
which
can
be
modeled
as
uncertain
objects
.

Different
from
certain
data
,
efficient
query
processing
on
uncertain
data
is
more
challenging
due
to
its
intensive
computation
of
probability
confidences
.

Thus
,
it
is
also
crucial
to
answer
subspace
queries
efficiently
and
effectively
over
uncertain
objects
.

Specifically
,
we
define
a
novel
query
,
namely
probabilistic
subspace
range
query
(
PSRQ
)
in
the
uncertain
database
,
which
finds
objects
within
a
distance
from
a
query
object
in
any
subspace
with
high
probability
.

To
address
this
query
,
we
extend
our
proposed
pruning
techniques
for
precise
data
to
that
of
answering
PSRQ
in
arbitrary
subspaces
.

Extensive
experiments
demonstrated
the
performance
of
our
proposed
approaches
.

In
the
present
work
a
model
is
proposed
which
is
useful
for
text
summarization
of
the
given
document
by
using
pattern
recognition
techniques
for
improving
the
retrieval
performance
of
the
relevant
information
.

The
design
and
implementation
of
the
proposed
systems
is
concerned
with
methods
for
summarizing
of
the
retrieving
information
from
a
collection
of
documents
or
corpuses
.

The
quality
of
a
system
is
measured
by
how
useful
it
is
to
the
typical
users
of
the
system
.

In
the
basic
approach
,
a
query
is
considered
generated
from
an
“
ideal
”
document
that
satisfies
the
information
need
.

The
system
’s
job
is
then
to
estimate
the
likelihood
of
each
document
in
the
collection
being
the
ideal
document
and
rank
them
accordingly
.

The
recent
development
of
related
techniques
stimulates
new
modeling
and
estimation
methods
that
are
beyond
the
scope
of
the
traditional
approaches
.

Rich
mark
-
up
can
considerably
benefit
the
process
of
establishing
bitext
correspondences
,
that
is
,
the
task
of
providing
correct
identification
and
alignment
methods
for
text
segments
that
are
translation
equivalences
of
each
other
in
a
parallel
corpus
.

We
present
a
sentence
alignment
algorithm
that
,
by
taking
advantage
of
previously
annotated
texts
,
obtains
accuracy
rates
close
to
100

The
algorithm
evaluates
the
similarity
of
the
linguistic
and
extralinguistic
mark
-
up
in
both
sides
of
a
bitext
.

Given
that
annotations
are
neutral
with
respect
to
typological
,
grammatical
and
orthographical
differences
between
languages
,
rich
mark
-
up
becomes
an
optimal
foundation
to
support
bitext
correspondences
.

The
main
originality
of
this
approach
is
that
it
makes
maximal
use
of
annotations
,
which
is
a
very
sensible
and
efficient
method
for
the
exploitation
of
parallel
corpora
when
annotations
exist
.

Adequate
encoding
schemes
applied
to
large
bodies
of
text
in
electronic
form
have
been
a
main
achievement
in
the
field
of
humanities
computing
.

Research
in
computational
linguistics
,
which
since
the
late
1980s
has
resorted
to
methodologies
involving
statistics
and
probabilities
in
large
corpora
,
has
however
largely
neglected
the
existence
and
provision
of
extra
information
from
such
encoding
schemes
.

In
this
paper
we
present
an
approach
to
sentence
alignment
that
crucially
relies
on
previously
introduced
annotations
in
a
parallel
corpus
.

Following

The
utility
of
annotated
bitexts
will
be
demonstrated
by
the
proposition
of
a
methodology
that
crucially
takes
advantage
of
rich
markup
to
resolve
bitext
correspondences
,
that
is

the
task
of

Moreover

the

with
evidence
that

)
will
progressively
be
replaced
by
richer
mark

up
(
e.g.

are
good
enough
reasons
to
investigate
methods
that
benefit
from
such
encoding
schemes

We
first
provide
details
of
how

sample
has
been
marked

,
with
particular
emphasis
on
the
recognition

Then
we
show
how
sentence
aligmnent
relies
on
mark

by
the
application
of
a
methodology
that
resorts
to
annotations
to
determine
the

This
paper
introduces
an
intelligent
sink
mechanism
based
on
the
observation
and
analysis
of
non
-
uniform
energy
consumption
problem
in
sensor
network
,
in
which
more
energy
consumed
at
nodes
near
the
sink
than
at
nodes
far
away
.

The
proposed
intelligent
sink
utilizes
dynamic
sink
proxies
for
localized
data
query
and
collection
,
so
as
to
achieve
highly
distributed
and
low
energy
consumption
among

.

The
evaluation
result
reveals
that
the
proposed
sink
mechanism
reduces
the
energy
consumption
of
information
retrieval
in
the
network
and
obtains
balanced

In
this
book
,
the
author
focuses
on
the
intersection
of
two
major
bodies
of
policy
and
practice
:
knowledge
economy
and
ICTs
on
one
hand
,
and
sustainable
economic
development
on
the
other
.

It
aims
to
provide
a
broad
-
ranging
account
of
the
social
and
economic
terrain
demarcated
by
this
intersection
in
order
to
reach
conclusions
and
offer
guidelines
for
policy
development
.

Although
based
on
the
case
of
a
developing
country
(
Vietnam
)
its
analyses
,
arguments
and
conclusions
are
of
universal
relevance
.

BACKGROUND
.

The
efficacy
of
carotid
endarterectomy
in
patients
with
asymptomatic
carotid
stenosis
has
not
been
confirmed
in
randomized
clinical
trials
,
despite
the
widespread
use
of
operative
intervention
in
such
patients
.

We
conducted
a
multicenter
clinical
trial
at
11
Veterans
Affairs
medical
centers
to
determine
the
effect
of
carotid
endarterectomy
on
the
combined
incidence
of
transient
ischemic
attack
,
transient
monocular
blindness
,
and
stroke
.

We
studied
444
men
with
asymptomatic
carotid
stenosis
shown
arteriographically
to
reduce
the
diameter
of
the
arterial
lumen
by
50
percent
or
more
.

The
patients
were
randomly
assigned
to
optimal
medical
treatment
including
antiplatelet
medication
(
aspirin
)
plus
carotid
endarterectomy
(
the
surgical
group
;
211
patients
)
or
optimal
medical
treatment
alone
(
the
medical
group
;
233
patients
All
the
patients
at
each
center
were
followed
independently
by
a
vascular
surgeon
and
a
neurologist
for
a
mean
of
47.9
months
.

The
combined
incidence
of
ipsilateral
neurologic
events
was
8.0
percent
in
the
surgical
group
and
20.6
percent
in
the
medical
group
(
P
0.001
giving
a
relative
risk
(
for
the
surgical
group
vs.
the
medical
group
)
of
0.38
(
95
percent
confidence
interval
,
0.22
to
0.67

The
incidence
of
ipsilateral
stroke
alone
was
4.7
percent
in
the
surgical
group
and
9.4
percent
in
the
medical
group
.

An
analysis
of
stroke
and
death
combined
within
the
first
30
postoperative
days
showed
no
significant
differences
.

Nor
were
there
significant
differences
between
groups
in
an
analysis
of
all
strokes
and
deaths

Overall

including

primarily
due
to
coronary
atherosclerosis
.

CONCLUSIONS
.

Carotid
endarterectomy
reduced
the
overall
incidence
of
ipsilateral
neurologic
events
in
a
selected
group
of
male
patients
with
asymptomatic
carotid
stenosis
.

We
did
not
find
a
significant
influence
of
carotid
endarterectomy
on
the
combined
incidence
of
stroke
and
death
,
but
because
of
the
size
of
our
sample
,
a
modest
effect
could
not
be
excluded
.

(
see
next
paragraph
but
as
seen
in
Chapter
6
,
many
search
systems
work
differently
and
yield
different
results
.

As
mentioned
above
,
since
the
MEDLINE
database
is
so
large
,
it
is
typically
segmented
into
smaller
components
.

This
is
done
for
a
variety
of
reasons
,
not
the
least
of
which
is
to
provide
users
with
the
ability
to
limit
the
size
of
their
retrieval
sets
.

It
also
allows
the
user
to
focus
on
a
particular
time
period
,
usually
the
recent
literature
of
the
past
few
years
.

This
approach
is
a
must
for

,
because
CD

disks
can
typically
only
store
the
equivalent

that

would
accelerate

Furthermore
,
the
ability

and
combine
results
through
a
common
architecture
and
a
robust
software
framework
would
accelerate
the
transfer
of
research
results
in

led
to

Architecture
Goals

In
six
major
labs
spread
out
over
the
globe
,
IBM
Research
has
over
200
people

)

with
a

focus

ranging
from

to

to

to

question
answering
.

Each
group
is
developing
different
technical
and
engineering
approaches
to
process
unstructured
information
(
e.g
natural
language
text
,
voice
,
audio
and
video
)
in
pursuit
of
specific
research
objectives
and
their
applications
.

The
high
-
level
objectives
of
IBM
’s
Unstructured
Information
Management
Architecture
(
UIMA
)
are
two
fold
:

1
)
Accelerate
scientific
advances
by
enabling
the
rapid
combination
UIM
technologies
(
e.g
natural
language
processing
,
video
analysis
,
information
retrieval
,
etc
2
)
Accelerate
transfer
of
UIM
technologies
to
product
by
providing
a
robust
software
framework
that
promotes
reuse
and
supports
flexible
deployment
options
.

UIMA
is
a
software
architecture
for
developing
applications
which
integrate
search
and
analytics
over
a
combination
of
structured
and
unstructured
information
.

We
define
structured
information
as
information
whose
intended
meaning
is
unambiguous
and
explicitly
represented
in
the
structure
or
format
of
the
data
.

The
canonical
example
is
a
database
table
.

We
define
unstructured
information
as
information
whose
intended
meaning
is
only
implied
by
its
form
.

The
canonical
example
is
a
natural
language
document
.

The
UIMA
high
-
level
architecture
,
illustrated
in
Figure
1
,
defines
the
roles
,
interfaces
and
communications
of
large
-
grained
components
essential
for
UIM
applications
.

These
include
components
capable
of
analyzing
unstructured
artifacts
,
integrating
and
accessing
structured
sources
and
storing
,
indexing
and
searching
for
artifacts
based
on
discovered
semantic
content
.

As
part
of
the
UIMA
project
,
IBM
is
developing
different
implementations
of
the
architecture
suitable
for
different
classes
of
deployment
.

These
range
from
lightweight
and
embeddable
implementations
to
highly
scaleable
implementations
that
are
meant
to
exploit
clusters
of
machines
and
provide
high
throughput
and
high
availability
.

While
the
architecture
extends
to
a
variety
of
unstructured
artifacts
including
voice
,
audio
and
video
,
a
primary
analytic
focus
of
current
UIMA
implementations
is
squarely
on
human
language
technologies
.

In
this
paper
we
will
refer
to
elements
of
unstructured
information
processing
as
documents
admitting
,
however
,
that
an
element
may
represent
for
the
application
,
a
whole
text
document
,
a
text
document
fragment
or
even
multiple
documents
.

2
Generalized
Application
Scenario
and
the
High
-
Level
Architecture

In
this
section
we
provide
a
high
-
level
overview
of
the
UIMA
architecture
by
describing
its
component
roles
in
a
generalized
application
scenario
.

The
generalized
scenario
includes
both
analysis
and
access
functions
.

Analysis
functions
are
divided
into
two
classes
,
namely
document
-
level
and
collection
-
level
analysis
.

Access
functions
are
divided
into
semantic
search
and
structured
knowledge
access
.

We
refer
to
the
software
program
that
employs
UIMA
components
to
implement
some
end
-
user
capability
as
the
application
or
application
program
.

The
paper
deals
with
the
concept
of
data
mining
whereby
the
data
resources
can
be
fetched
and
accessed
accordingly
with
reduced
time
complexity
.

Resource
sharing
is
an
important
aspect
in
the
field
of
information
science
.

The
retrieval
techniques
are
pointed
out
based
on
the
ideas
of
binary
search
tree
,
Gantt
chart
,
text
summarization
.

A
theorem
has
been
cited
regarding
the
summation
of
total
length
of
codes
of
each
leaf
search
term
.

Summarization
is
a
hard
problem
of
Natural
Language
Processing
because
,
to
do
it
properly
,
one
has
to
really
understand
the
point
of
a
text
.

This
requires
semantic
analysis
,
discourse
processing
,
and
inferential
interpretation
(
grouping
of
the
content
using
world
knowledge
The
last
step
,
especially
,
is
complex
,
because
systems
without
a
great
deal
of
world
knowledge
simply
can
not
do
it
.

Therefore
,
attempts
so
far
of
performing
true
abstraction
--
creating
abstracts
as
summaries
--
have
not
been
very
successful
.

Fortunately
,
however
,
an
approximation
called
extraction
is
more
feasible
today
.

To
create
an
extract
,
a
system
need
simply
to
identify
the
most
important
/
topical
/
central
topic(s
)
of
the
text
,
and
return
them
to
the
reader
.

Although
the
summary
is
not
necessarily
coherent
,
the
reader
can
form
an
opinion
of
the
content
of
the
original
.

Most
automated
summarization
systems
today
produce
extracts
only
.

Another
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
addresses
the
problem
of
information
discovery
in
large
collections
of
text
.

For
users
,
one
of
the
key
problems
in
working
with
such
collections
is
determining
where
to
focus
their
attention
.

Text
documents
often
contain
valuable
structured
data
that
is
hidden
in
regular
English
sentences
.

This
data
is
best
exploited
if
available
as
a
relational
table
that
we
could
use
for
answering
precise
queries
or
for
running
data
mining
tasks
.

We
explore
a
technique
for
extracting
such
tables
from
document
collections
that
requires
only
a
handful
of
training
examples
from
users
.

In
this
paper
we
have
tried
to
explain
how
to
extract
the
different
kind
of
relationship
between
the
words
with
the
help
of
a
frame
net
analysis
diagram
of
an
annotation
layer
software
.

has
been
claimed
to
be
a
common
strategy
among
academic
authors
.

From
a
sociology

perspective
,
as
well
as
from
a

perspective
,
it
is
both
an
interesting
claim

a

one
.

The

presents
a

of
the

board
members
entering
American
Economic
Review
from
1984
to
2004
using
a
citation
window
of
11
years
.

In
order
to
test
the
flattery
citations
hypothesis
further
we
have
conducted
a
study
applying
the
difference
-

estimator
.

We
analyse
the
number
of
times
the
editors

editorial

of
the

were
cited
in
articles
published

well
as
in

pool
of

comprising
of

from

The

Dynamic
search
is
an
information
retrieval
task
,
in
which
information
systems
retrieve
documents
for
a

Each
query
starts
a
search
iteration
and
aims
to
fulfill

of
the
user
’s

realize
that
each
query
reflects
one
facet
on
the

complex
information

and

to

Another

employs

Latent

to

In

the

and
diversifies
the

these

This
thesis
proposes
to
structure
the
user

information
need
as
an

(
a

for

to
utilize

on
the

to

in

The
ontology
presents
a
clear
landscape
for
search
engine
’s
explorations
and
improves
the
effectiveness
and
efficiency
of
the

The

can
be
obtained
through
extra

or
built
on
top
of
topic
construction
algorithms
,
such
as
nomothetic

hierarchy
construction

In
this

,
we
presume
the

is
presented

Software
projects
can
grow
very
rapidly
,
reaching
hundreds
or
thousands
of
files
in
a
relatively
short
time
span
.

Therefore
,
manually
finding
the
source
code
parts
that
should
be
changed
in
order
to
fix
a
failure
is
a
difficult
task
.

Static
bug
localization
techniques
provide
cost
-
effective
means
of
finding
files
related
to
the
failure
described
in
a
bug
report
.

Recently
,
structured
information
retrieval
(
IR
)
has
been
used
to
improve
the
effectiveness
of
static
bug
localization
,
being
successfully
applied
by
techniques
such
as
BLUiR
,
BLUiR
and
AmaLgam
.

However
,
there
are
some
significant
shortcomings
on
how
these
techniques
were
evaluated
.

First
,
virtually
all
evaluations
have
been
limited
to
very
few
projects
written
in
only
one
object
-
oriented
programming
language
,
particularly
Java
.

Therefore
,
the
effectiveness
of
these
techniques
in
other
widely
-
used
object
-
oriented
languages
such
as
C
#
is
still
unknown
.

Second
,
the
experimental
setup
for
most
of
the
evaluations
make
simplistic
assumptions
that
do
not
hold
on
real
-
world
scenarios
,
thereby
raising
doubts
about
the
reported
effectiveness
of
these
techniques
.

In
this
paper
,
we
evaluate
BLUiR
,
BLUiR
and
AmaLgam
on
20
C
#
projects
,
providing
a
first
assessment
of
these
techniques
on
a
previously
untested
object
-
oriented
language
.

Moreover
,
we
set
up
an
experiment
that
addresses
the
simplistic
assumptions
commonly
present
in
bug
localization
studies
,
thereby
providing
evidence
on
how
their
findings
may
be
biased
.

Finally
,
we
extend
the
algorithms
of
existing
techniques
in
order
to
understand
if
structured
information
retrieval
can
benefit
from
the
use
of
a
wider
range
of
program
constructs
,
including
C
#
constructs
inexistent
in

In
recent
years
,
the
algorithms
of
learning
to
rank
have
been
proposed
by
researchers
.

However
,
in
information
retrieval
,
instances
of
ranks
are
imbalanced
.

After
the
instances
of
ranks
are
composed
to
pairs
,
the
pairs
of
ranks
are
imbalanced
too
.

In
this
paper
,
a
cost
-
sensitive
risk
minimum
model
of
pairwise
learning
to
rank
imbalanced
data
sets
is
proposed
.

Following
this
model
,
the
algorithm
of
cost
-
sensitive
supported
vector
learning
to
rank
is
investigated
.

In
experiment
,
the
standard
Ranking
SVM
is
used
as
baseline
.

The
document
retrieval
data
set
is
used
in
experiment
.

The
experiment
results
show
that
the
performance
of
cost
-
sensitive
support
vector
learning
to
rank
is
better
than
Ranking
SVM
on
two
rank
imbalanced
data
sets

Web
as
a
result
of
modern
Web

,
user

and
annotation
,
and
emerg-

.

These

annotations
hold
the
promise
to
significantly
enhance
information

,
by
enhancing
the
depth
of

begin
to
un-

derstand
how
these
valuable
semantic
cues
can
be
put
to
fruitful
use
.

Unleashing
the
potential
of
semantic
annotations
requires
us
to
think
outside
the
box
,
by
combining
the
insights
of
natural
lan-

processing
(
NLP
)
to
go
beyond
bags
of
words
,
the
insights
of
databases
(

to
use
structure
efficiently
even
when
aggregating
over

,
the
insights
of
information
retrieval
(
IR
)
in
effective
goal

directed
search
and
evaluation
,
and
the
insights
of
knowledge
management
(
KM
)
to
get
grips
on
the
greater
whole
.

This
workshop
aims
to
bring
together
researchers
from
these
dif-
ferent
disciplines
and
work
together
on
one
of
the
greatest
chal-
lenges
in
the

The
desired
result
of
the
workshop
will
be
to
gain
concrete
insight
into
the
potential
of
semantic
an-

,
and
in
concrete
steps
to
take
this
research
forward

in
ways
that
combine
the
strengths
of

where
every

In

we
examine
the

a
“

”
approach
to
study
search
strategy
.

We
describe
“
goal

based
information
search
”
using
a
framework
of
Knowledge
Discovery
.

We
identify
two
Information

(
IR
)
goals
using
the
constructs
of
Knowledge
Acquisition
(
KA
)
and
Knowledge
Explanation
(

We
classify
these
constructs
into
two
specific
information
problems
:
An
exploration

problem
and
an
implicitexplicit

.

Our

framework
is
an
extension
of

applying
an
IR

originally
developed
for

Requirements
tracing

However
,
in
large

evolving

,
maintaining

manually
can
become
a
tedious
task
.

To
address
this
problem
,
several

were
introduced
to
provide
automatic

These
techniques
are
usually
based

methods
which
link

(
CACP
)
is
under
development
in

of
Total

(

tool
,
to
address
the
requirements
of

for

.

The
unique
aspects
of
CACP
include
:
1
)
a
design
with
respect
to
an
integrated
construction
management
system
based
on
emerging
industry
information
standards
(
i.e

Alliance
for

)
the
consideration
of
quality
,
organizational
,
and
procurement
aspects
of
planning
in
addition
to
time
,
cost
and
scope
,
and
3
)
the
application
of
CBR
to
facilitate
the
re
-
use
of
captured
planning
knowledge
.

CACP
's
data
structure
builds
on
past
efforts
of
developing
data
standards
within
the
AEC
industry
(
e.g
ISO
STEP
and
IAI
IFCs
)
and
contributes
to
current
efforts
with
a
focus
in
the
construction
management
domain
.

With
a
solid
data
structure
,
CACP
's
planning
approach
can
use
organized
specialization
and
aggregation
constructs
to
promote
efficient
storage
and
retrieval
mechanisms
.

The
CBR
tool
is
then
used
to
guide
the
user
to
a
past
plan
that
best
meets
the
current
project
requirements
and
presents
this
information
for
modification
to
meet
all
project
requirements
.

The
paper
briefly
describes
the
data
structure
and
planning
approach
used
and
primarily
focuses
on
the
application
of
CBR
to
achieve
a
scenario
where
the
re
-
application
of
past
planning
knowledge
is
possible

ion
and
representation
Information
encoding
with
medical
terminology
systems
is
mainly
used
on
the
two
different
levels
of
abstraction
and
representation
[
28
The
purpose
with
abstraction
is
to
distil
the
underlying
information
and
is
used
when
different
kinds
of
information
compilations
are
created
[
21
One
example
is
when
a
note
in
a
health
record
exhaustively
describes
in
free
text
that
the
patient
has
pneumonia
caused
by
a
specific
bacterium
,
in
specific
sites
of
the
lungs
,
has
a
range
of
accompanied
symptoms
,
and
is
of
varying
severity
.

The
note
can
then
be
abstracted
using
the
category
Bacterial
pneumonia
from
a
terminology
system
[
21
International
Classification
of
Diseases
,
ICD
,
Enrichment
of
Terminology
Systems
for
Use
and
Reuse
in
Medical
Information
Systems
16
is
the
international
standard
to
use
for
this
kind
of
abstraction
for
epidemiological
purposes
[
29
Other
examples
of
usages
are
to
compile
incidence
of
mortality
of
surgical
procedures
,
and
to
measure
cost
efficiency
.

Abstraction
can
also
be
used
for
information
retrieval
,
by
using
the
associated
category
to
retrieve
cases
of
a
specific
type
[
21
Association
of
each
information
entity
to
a
problem
in
the
problemoriented
health
record
is
also
a
kind
of
abstraction
.

However
,
there
is
in
general
no
requirement
to
encode
the
problems
with
categories
from
a
terminology
system
[
9
-
10
The
purpose
of
representation
is
to
represent
as
much
of
the
underlying
information
as
possible
in
computable
form
;
it
is
used
when
detailed
information
is
required
in
information
processing

[
21
To
represent
the
information
in
the
pneumonia
example
above
,
the
terminology
systems
need
to
represent
every
attribute
of
the
pneumonia
,
such
as
which
bacterium
caused
the
pneumonia
and
in
which
sites
of
the
lung
the
pneumonia
is
located
.

Examples
of
usages
are
feeding
decision
support
systems
with
patient
information
,
producing
summary
reviews
,
and
quality
assurance
[
21
Preand
post
-
coordination
Information
can
be
encoded
using
both
pre
-
coordinated
and
postcoordinated
categories
[
21
When
pre
-
coordination
is
used
,
each
encoding
consists
of
only
one
category
from
the
terminology
system
.

This
means
that
only
categories
included
in
the
terminology
system
can
be
encoded
[
21
When
post
-
coordination
is
used
,
each
encoding
consists
of
a
combination
of
categories
from
the
terminology
system
.

This
means
that
both
categories
included
in
the
terminology
system
and
combinations
of
the
included
categories
can
be
encoded
[
21
Multilingual
terminology
systems
Multilingual
terminology
systems
can
enhance
the
understanding
of
the
health
record
information
in
different
languages
[
30
-
31

This
is
because
the
encoded
information
can
be
shown
in
any
of
the
languages
the
terminology
systems
are
translated
into
.

Machine
translation
of
the
underlying
information
is
more
complicated

Computational
modelling
of

similarity
is
an
increasingly
important
part
of
personalisation
and
optimisation
in
music
information
retrieval
and
research
in
music
perception
and
cognition
.

The
use
of
relative
similarity
ratings
is
a
new
and
promising
approach
to
modelling
similarity
that
avoids
well
known
problems
with
absolute
ratings
.

In

,
we
use
relative
ratings
from
the
MagnaTagATune
dataset
with
new
and
existing
variants
of
state
-
of
-
the
-
art
algorithms
and
provide
the
first
comprehensive
and
rigorous
evaluation
of
this
approach
.

We
compare
metric
learning
based
on
support
vector
machines
(
SVMs
)
and
metric
-
learning
-
to
-
rank
(
MLR
including
a
diagonal
and
a
novel
weighted
variant
,
and
relative
distance
learning
with
neural
networks
(
RDNN
We
further
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
different
high
and
low
level
audio
features
and
genre
data
,
as
well
as
dimensionality
reduction
methods
,
weighting
of
similarity
ratings
,
and
different
sampling
methods
.

Our
results
show
that
music
similarity
measures
learnt
on
relative
ratings
can
be
significantly
better
than
a
standard
Euclidian
metric
,
depending
on
the
choice
of
learning
algorithm
,
feature
sets
and
application
scenario
.

MLR
and
SVM
outperform
DMLR
and
RDNN
,
while
MLR
with
weighted
ratings
leads
to
no
further
performance
gain
.

Timbral
and
music
-
structural
features
are
most
effective
,
and
all
features
jointly
are
significantly
better
than
any
other
combination
of
feature
sets
.

Sharing
audio
clips
(
but
not
the
similarity
ratings
)
between
test
and
training
sets
improves
performance
,
in
particular
for
the
SVM
-
based
methods
,
which
is
useful
for
some
applications
scenarios

when
the
data
is
abundant
,
but
labeling
is
expensive
or
requires
human
assistance
.

Our
approach
develops
a
framework
for
regularization
on
such
graphs
.

The
algorithms
are
very
simple
and
involve
solving
a
single
,
usually
sparse
,
system
of
linear
equations
.

Using
the
notion
of
algorithmic
stability
,
we
derive
bounds
on
the
generalization
error
and
relate
it
to
structural
invariants
of
the
graph
.

Some
experimental
results
testing
the
performance
of
the
regularization
algorithm
and
the
usefulness
of
the
generalization
bound
are

Knowing
the
degree
of
semantic
contrast
between
words
has
widespread
application
in
natural
language
processing
,
including
machine
translation
,
information
retrieval
,
and
dialogue
systems
.

Manually
-
created
lexicons
focus
on
opposites
,
such
as
hot
and
cold
.

Opposites
are
of
many
kinds
such
as
antipodals
,
complementaries
,
and
gradable
.

However
,
existing
lexicons
often
do
not
classify
opposites
into
the
different
kinds
.

They
also
do
not
explicitly
list
word
pairs
that
are
not
opposites
but
yet
have
some
degree
of
contrast
in
meaning
,
such
as
warm
and
cold
or
tropical
and
freezing
.

We
propose
an
automatic
method
to
identify
contrasting
word
pairs
that
is
based
on
the
hypothesis
that
if
a
pair
of
words
,
A
and
B
,
are
contrasting
,
then
there
is
a
pair
of
opposites
,
C
and
D
,
such
that
A
and
C
are
strongly
related
and
B
and
D
are
strongly
related
For
example
,
there
exists
the
pair
of
opposites
hot
and
cold
such
that
tropical
is
related
to
hot
,
and
freezing
is
related
to
cold
We
will
call
this
the
contrast
hypothesis
.

We
begin
with
a
large
crowdsourcing
experiment
to
determine
the
amount
of
human
agreement
on
the
concept
of
oppositeness
and
its
different
kinds
.

In
the
process
,
we
flesh
out
key
features
of
different
kinds
of
opposites
.

We
then
present
an
automatic
and
empirical
measure
of
lexical
contrast
that
relies
on
the
contrast
hypothesis
,
corpus
statistics
,
and
the
structure
of
a
Roget
-
like
thesaurus
.

We
show
how
using
four
different
datasets
,
we
evaluated
our
approach
on
two
different
tasks
,
solving
“
most
contrasting
word
”
questions
and
distinguishing
synonyms
from
opposites
.

The
results
are
analyzed
across
four
parts
of
speech
and
across
five
different
kinds
of
opposites
.

We
show
that
the
proposed
measure
of
lexical
contrast
obtains
high
precision
and
large
coverage
,
outperforming
existing
methods
.

In
this
paper
,
the
task
of
text
segmentation
is
approached
from
a
topic
modeling
perspective
.

We
investigate
the
use
of
latent
Dirichlet
allocation
(
LDA
)
topic
model
to
segment
a
text
into
semantically
coherent
segments
.

A
major
benefit
of
the
proposed
approach
is
that
along
with
the
segment
boundaries
,
it
outputs
the
topic
distribution
associated
with
each
segment
.

This
information
is
of
potential
use
in
applications
like
segment
retrieval
and
discourse
analysis
.

The
new
approach
outperforms
a
standard
baseline
method
and
yields
significantly
better
performance
than
most
of
the
available
unsupervised
methods
on

We
propose
a
construction
of
a
single

private
information
retrieval
system
using
fully
homomorphic
encryption
.

The
construction
results
in
a
system
with
Ω(log2

communication
complexity
,
and
polylogarithmic
computational
overhead
,
in
the
size
of
the
database
.

An
improved
construction
is
also
proposed
,
which
reduces
the
client
’s
communication
overhead
,
and
leaves
open
the
possibility
of
reducing
the
total
communication
overhead
.

This
results
in
a
construction
which
has
higher
communication
overhead
than
the
current
optimal
system
,

which
is
more

Rhetorical
structure
theory
(
RST

is
one
of
the
leading
theories
in
computational
linguistics
.

It
improved
the

E
cient
and
accurate
information
retrieval
is
a
key
issue
in
image
databases
.

Since
image
databases
use
image
features
for
retrieval
,
traditional
alphanumeric
indexing
methods
are
not
particularly
suitable
for
content
-
based
retrieval
.

Therefore
,
new
indexing
methods
must
be
designed
and
implemented
speci
cally
for
image
retrieval
.

In
this
paper
,
we
propose
to
use
competitive
learning
clustering
algorithm
to
produce
an
indexing
structure
for
Montage
,
which
is
an
image
database
supporting
content

using
color
,
texture
,
sketch
,
and
shape
for
Hong
Kong
's
fashion
,
textile
,
and
clothing
industry
.

Competitive
learning
is
a
stochastic
and
e
cient
clustering
method
which
provides
good
cluster
center
approximation
for
image
database
indexing
.

Using
synthetic
data
,
we
demonstrate
the
Recall
and
Precision
performance
of
nearest
neighbor
feature
retrieval
based
on
the
indexing
structure
generated
by
competitive
learning
clustering
and
show
that
the
algorithm
works
well

Maintaining
mobile
agent
availability
in
the
presence
of
agent
server
crashes
is
a
challenging
issue
since
developers
normally
have
no
control
over
remote
agent
servers
.

A
popular
technique
is
that
a
mobile
agent
injects
a
replica
into
stable
storage
upon
its
arrival
at
each
agent
server
.

However
,
a
server
crash
leaves
the
replica
unavailable
,
for
an
unknown
time
period
,
until
the
agent
server
is
back
on
-
line
.

This
paper
uses
exception
handling
to
maintain
the
availability
of
mobile
agents
in
the
presence
of
agent
server
crash
failures
.

Two
exception
handler
designs
are
proposed
.

The
first
exists
at
the
agent
server
that
created
the
mobile
agent
.

The
second
operates
at
the
previous
agent
server
visited
by
the
mobile
agent
.

Initial
performance
results
demonstrate
that
although
the
second
design
is
slower
it
offers
the
smaller
trip
time
increase
in
the
presence
of
agent
server
crashes

The
production
systems
used
by
the
subsea
petroleum
industry
are
knowledge
and
information
intensive
.

Any
problem
needs
to
be
solved
quickly
and
efficiently
avoiding
decommissioning
or
waiting
for
the
symptoms
to
be
escalated
.

This
requires
precise
information
to
be
supplied
on
-
time
.

For
this
reason
we
have
proposed
rule
-
based
monitoring
of
device
performance
.

However
,
covering
all
possible
cases
by
rules
is
a
labour
-
intensive
and
not
trivial
task
.

Therefore
,
in
this
paper
we
propose
a
scenario
-
driven
information
retrieval
approach
to
complement
rule
-
based
monitoring
.

The
main
objective
is
to
automatically
formulate
a

is

Information
Retrieval
(
IR
)
typically
retrieves
entire
documents
in
response
to
a
user
's
information
need
.

However
,
many
times
a
user
would
prefer
to
examine
smaller
portions
of
a
document
.

One
example
of
this
is
when
building
a
frame
-
based
representation
of
a
text
.

The
user
would
like
to
read
all
and
only
those
portions
of
the
text
that
are
about
predeened
important
features
.

This
research
addresses
the
problem
of
automatically
locating
text
about
these
features
,
where
the
important
features
are
those
deened
for
use
by
a
case
-
based
reasoning
(
CBR
)
system
in
the
form
of
slots
and
llers
.

We
propose
to
use
a
small
set
of
\annotations
textual
segments
,
that
we
saved
when
creating
our
original
case
-
base
to
generate
queries
and
retrieve
relevant
passages
.

Annotations
are
associated
with
the
slot
about
which
they
provide
information
.

Using
a
case
-
base
of
annotations
for
each
slot
we
generate
and
pose
a
query
to
an
IR
system
that
is
aimed
at
the
retrieval
of
passages
within
a
relevant
document
.

By
locating
passages
for
display
to
the
user
,
we
winnow
a
text
down
to
sets
of
several
sentences
,
greatly
reducing
the
time
and
eeort
expended
searching
through
each
text
for
important

,
a
supervised
neural
network
has
been
used
to
classify
pairs
of

Classification
is
based
on
the

In

a
number
of
problems
and
their
solutions
are
faced
.

First
the
results
of
a
study
conducted
within

among
business
decision
makers
,
with
the
objective
to
get
an
insight
in
their
external
Business
Information
need
,
are
discussed
.

The
results
show
that
external
information
is
very
valuable
for
them
and
that
Business
Information
from
the
WWW
is
seen
to
be
an
important
source
.

The
outcomes
of
this

and
the
review
of

led
to
the
development
of
a
visual
information

system
for
Business

called
INSYDER
.

The
Information
Retrieval
aspects
of
this
system
are
in
the
focus
of
this
work
,
whereas
the
visualisations
aspects
are
discussed
in
[
Mann
2002
It
has
been
intended
to
develop
a
system
giving
a
big
added
-
value
to
the
user
.

For
this
various
components
have
been
designed
.

The
visualisation
of
the
query
for
an
interactive
query
expansion
assists
the
user
in
the
first
step
of
the
information
seeking
process
.

The
proposed
ranking
and
classification
components
support
the
user
when
reviewing
results
.

Hereby
the
ranking
analyses
document
by
document
on
-
the
-
fly
.

This
way
a
comparable
ranking
,
not
relying
on
an
overall
document
collection
,
has
been
achieved
.

For
a
redefinition
of
the
initial
query
a
relevance
feedback
option
has
also
been
included
.

The
evaluation
of
the
retrieval
performance
using
TREC
data
shows
the
system
's
effectiveness
.

As

Due
to
the
large
size
of
the
Web
,
users
require
specialized
tools
to
navigate
through
the
vast
volumes
of
data
,
and
a
number
of
search
engines
and
other
IR
tools
have
been
built
to
fill
this
need
.

The
major
engines
are
typically
based
on
scalable
clusters
,
i.e
large
numbers
of
low
-
cost
servers
at
a
single
location
.

Recent
events
have
seen
a
concentration
in
this
market
towards
a
small
number
of
major
players
that
offer
their
own
proprietary
ranking
and
user
tools
.

For
various
reasons
,
these
engines
do
not
provide
open
interfaces
to
the
lower
layers
of
their
infrastructure
,
but
offer
a
service
that
combines
these
layers
with
ranking
and
user
interface
.

We
are
proposing
a
two

tier
model
of
web
IR
architectures
that
separates
the
lower
layers
of
data
acquisition
,
index
construction
,
and
index
lookups
from
the
higher
layers
of
ranking
and
user
interfaces
.

Under
this
model
,
we
investigate
the
problem
of
implementing
the
lower
tier
in
a
peer
-
to
-
peer
environment
,
with
an
open
and
agnostic
interface
that
allows
a
variety
of
search
and
navigation
tools
and
interfaces
,
located
at
clients
or
intermediaries
,
to
be
built
on
top
.

Our
approach
is
motivated
by
expected
increases
in
client
computing
power
and
bandwidth
.

In
particular
,
we
see
the
possibility
for
a
rich
variety
of
novel
search
and
navigational
tools
and
interfaces
that
exploit
client
computing
power
and
bandwidth
and
that
rely
on
access
to
a
powerful
lower
-
level
search
infrastructure
.

These
tools
may
perform
a
large
number
of
search
engine
accesses
during
a
single
user
interaction
,
and
present
the
results
in
a
highly
optimized
and
aggregated
form
.

We
speculate
that
the
expected
increase
in
query
load
could
be
handled
by
a
highly
distributed
scalable
architecture
at
the
lower
tier
that
offers
an
open
interface
to
the
upper
tier
.

We
admit
that
this
vision
faces
significant
technical
and
economic
hurdles
,
and
we
are
not
at
all
certain
it
will
come
to
pass
.

However
,
we
argue
that
the
idea
of
an
open
,
agnostic
,
and
scalable
infrastructure
is
interesting
enough
to
merit
detailed
study
,
as
it
is
also
relevant
in
more
limited
scenarios
such
as
search
in
intranet
environments
or
P2P
communities
,
and
thus
we
have
started
designing
and
implementing
a
prototype
at
Polytechnic
.

In
this
position
paper
,
we
discuss
pros
and
cons
of
this
approach
,
outline
the
basic
technical
challenges
,
and
describe
a
prototype
we
are
building

This
discussion
takes
the
position
that
information
retrieval
systems
are
fundamentally
linguistic
in
nature
in
essence
,
the
languages
of
document
representation
and
searching
are
dialects
of
natural
language
.

Because
of
this
,
the
discipline
of
the
Philosophy
of
Language
should
have
some
bearing
on
the
problems
of
document
representation
and
search
query
formulation
.

The
philosophies
of
Austin
,
Searle
,
Grice
and
Wittgenstein
are
briefly
examined
and
their
relevance
to
information
retrieval
theory
is

Summary
form
only
given
.

The
role
of
information
technology
(
IT
)
employees
has
undergone
dramatic
changes
over
the
years
.

In
the
1960s
and
1970s
,
IT
employees
were
highly
valued
for
their
technical
skills
in
managing
computer
operations
,
programming
,
and
processing
data
.

However
,
in
organizations
today
,
they
are
expected
to
be
proficient
in
business
operations
,
management
,
and
interpersonal
communication
.

This
shift
in
skills
and
competence
requirements
of
IT
employees
challenges
them
to
adopt
customer
-
oriented
behaviors
and
to
strive
for
excellent
customer
services
.

Service
organizations
,
such
as
IT
help
desks
and
call
centers
,
have
long
emphasized
the
importance
of
service
quality
and
customer
satisfaction
(
i.e
service
effectiveness

Yet
IT
service
employees
are
often
evaluated
on
the
timeliness
and
volume
of
service
calls
(
i.e
service
efficiency
Balancing
the
trade
-
off
between
the
two
performance
measures
effectiveness
versus
efficiency
becomes
a
fundamental
dilemma
for
IT
executives
and
managers
.

Moreover
,
the
increasing
emphasis
on
customer
satisfaction
has
blurred
the
boundary
between
in
-
role
(
expected
job
duties
)
and
extra
-
role
(
discretionary
)
customer
service
behaviors
in
IT
services
.

To
enhance
our
understanding
,
in
this
article
,
we
seek
to
address
two
questions
1
)
what
types
of
customer
-
oriented
behaviors
do
IT
service
employees
demonstrate
2
)
How
do
customer
-
oriented
behaviors
affect
an
IT
service
employee
's
task
efficiency
?

To
answer
our
questions
,
we
draw
on
the
literature
on
organizational
citizenship
behaviors
(
OCBs
defined
as
discretionary
behaviors
that
promote
the
effective
functioning
of
an
organization
but
not
part
of
the
formal
job
description
.

An
example
of
OCBs
would
be
that
one
team
member
offers
to
help
a
newcomer
learn
how
to
perform
a
specific
team
task
.

In
our
research
,
we
focus
on
IT
employees
'
discretionary
behaviors
directed
to
their
business
counterparts
(
end
-
users
and
refer
to
those
behaviors
as
customer
-
oriented
OCBs
.

The
study
is
based
on
our
empirical
investigation
of
an
Enterprise
System
Support
Center
in
a
large
healthcare
organization
that
implemented
two
enterprise
resource
planning
(
ERP
)
applications
HR
/
Payroll
Management
and
Supplier
Relationship
Management
.

In
this
article
,
we
discuss
five
major
types
of
customer
-
oriented
OCBs
anticipation
,
education
,
justification
,
personalization
-
business
,
personalization
-
technology
in
the
provision
of
IS
support
services
,
and
empirically
test
the
association
between
the
five
types
of
OCBs
and
employees
'
task
efficiency
.

Using
a
sample
of
587
records
from
the
support
center
's
ticketing
database
,
we
show
that
an
customer
-
oriented
OCB
is
negatively
associated
with
task
efficiency
in
IS
support
services
,
but
not
all
types
of
citizenship
behaviors
have
a
significant
,
negative
effect
on
an
IT
employee
's
task
efficiency
.

Among
the
five
OCB
types
,
the
OCBs
related
to
anticipation
,
justification
,
and
personalization
-
technology
are
found
to
require
significantly
more
efforts
from
IT
employees
,
compared
to
the
non
-
OCB
instances
.

When
support
tasks
are
informational
(
i.e
information
retrieval
the
efforts
required
to
perform
personalization
-
technology
OCBs
become
minimal
.

Organizations
should
promote
the
customer
-
oriented
behaviors
of
their
IT
employees
,
and
consider
them
as
a
promising
and
value
-
added
source
for
enhancing
effective
use
of
organizational
IS
.

In
the
meantime
,
it
is
worth
noting
that
those
customer
-
oriented
behaviors
will
cost
IT
employees
extra
efforts
,
affecting
their
task
efficiency
.

In
this
regard
,
our
study
urges
both
academia
and
industry
practitioners
to
update
our
views
of
IT
employees
'
role
in
organizational
IS
support
and
to
promote
human
resource
policies
related
to
the
development
of
IT
professionals
.

The
advent
of
Internet
as
a
global
communication
medium
has
brought
a
new
focus
on
an
area
of
research
in
designing
Intelligent
Tutoring
System
(
ITS
)
that
has
not
been
adequately
considered
so
far
.

In
the
main
,
this
has
been
due
to
the
localised
nature
of
most
academic
environments
limiting
the
sources
of
information
and
an
implicit
assumption
that
information
and
knowledge
are
synonymous
.

These
factors
have
led
to
overemphasis
on
learner
modelling
in
the
traditional
ITS
research
,
which
seeks
to
enhance
the
interaction
between
the
ITS
as
the
provider
and
the
learner
as
the
consumer
of
knowledge
,
ignoring
the
crucial
role
played
by
the
teacher
in
enhancing
the
learning
in
a
given
context
.

The
limitations
of
the
traditional
approach
become
more
visible
when
educational
information
is
sought
to
be
transmitted
across
long
distances
and
the
need
for
adaptation
to
local
contexts
becomes
apparent
.

This
paper
argues
that
the
human
teacher
,
as
the
manager
of
learning
,
plays
a
vital
role
within
the
joint
cognitive
system
consisting
of
the
teacher
,
ITS
,
learner
and
learning
peers
.

This
role
needs
to
be
recognised
by
ITS
designers
by
through
a
teacher
model
.

It
also
suggests
that
ITS
may
perhaps
best
embody
the
emerging
framework
of
Informing
Science

—
Information
Retrieval
is
a
process
made
by
a
user
to
obtain
relevant
information
which
meets
his
needs
using
an
Information
Retrieval
System
(
IRS
However
the
IRS
shows
some
differences
between
user
relevance
and
system
relevance
.

These
variations
are
primarily
related
to
the
imperfection
of
the
indexing
process
(
approach
directly
related
to
the
IR
)
and
specially
the
non
consideration
of
the
user
profile
.

This
paper
presents
a
study
about
formalisms
proposed
in
the
literature
and
addresses
some
reflections
to
deal
with
problems
arising
from
this
survey

We
apply
a
recent
formalization
of
visualization
as
information
retrieval
to
linear
projections
.

We
introduce
a
method
that
optimizes
a
linear
projection
for
an
information
retrieval
task
:
retrieving
neighbors
of
input
samples
based
on
their
low
-
dimensional
visualization
coordinates
only
.

The
simple
linear
projection
makes
the
method
easy
to
interpret
,
while
the
visualization
task
is
made
well
-
defined
by
the
novel
information
retrieval
criterion
.

The
method
has
a
further
advantage
:
it
projects
input
features
,
but
the
input
neighborhoods
it
preserves
can
be
given
separately
from
the
input
features
,
e.g.
by
external
data
of
sample
similarities
.

Thus
the
visualization
can
reveal
the
relationship
between
data
features
and
complicated
data
similarities
.

We
further
extend
the
method
to
kernel
-
based
projections

The
usual
method
for
storing
tables
in
a
relational
database
is
to
store
each
tuple
contiguously
in
secondary
storage
.

A
simple
alternative
is
to
store
the
columns
contiguously
,
so
that
a
table
is
represented
as
a
set
of
vectors
all
of
the
same
length
.

It
has
been
shown
that
such
a
representation
performs
well
on
queries
requiring
few
columns
.

This
paper
reviews
the
shredding
scheme
used
in
XMill
,
an
XML
compressor
,
which
represents
the
document
structure
by
using
a
set
of
files
,
consisting
of
a
file
describing
the
structure
,
and
files
describing
the
character
data
to
be
found
on
designated
paths
(
corresponding
to
the
column
data

We
consider
such
a
shredding
as
a
storage
model

–XML
vectorization
–by
presenting
an
indexing
scheme
and
a
physical
algebra
associated
with
a
detailed
cost
model
.

We
study
query
processing
on
the
XML
vectorization
,
in
particular
the
XML
join
queries
.

XML
join
queries
are
often
translated
into
a
few
relational
join
operations
in
the
relational
-
based
XML
storage
systems
.

The
use
of
columns
enables
us
to
develop
a
fast
join
algorithm
for
vectorized
XML
based
on
two
hashbased
join
algorithms
.

The
important
feature
of
the
join
algorithm
is
that
the
disk
access
of
the
algorithm
is
mostly
sequential
and
the
data
not
needed
are
not
read
from
disk
.

Experimental
results
demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of
the
join
algorithm
for
vectorized
XML

The
importance
of
Information
Technology
in
healthcare
can
not
be
overestimated
in
today
's
world
.

With
the
rapid
development
of
Information
Technology

(
IT
)
there
is
an
ever
-
growing
emphasis
on
the
use
of
IT
in
the
research
and
practice
of
healthcare
.

The
research
in
health
information
technology
has
been
motivated
by
several
developments
,
including
electronic
medical
records
,
emphasis
on
personalized
medicine
and
research
on
genomic
data
,
and
development
of
computational
techniques
for
finding
patterns
to
name
a
few
.

Along
with
these
new
privacy
concerns
for
electronic
medical
records
and
their
access
to
third
parties
has
become
an
important
issue
.

In
this
article
we
discuss
some
of
the
recent
research
on
health
information
technology
within
the
context
of
the
following
areas
:
pattern
recognition
in
medicine
,
privacy
and
security
issues
in
healthcare
,
and
clinical
decision
support
.

Pattern
recognition
algorithms
are
powerful
techniques
that
can
identify
hidden
patterns
in
data
that
can
be
beneficial
for
medical
diagnosis
,
treatment
management
,
epidemiological
studies
,
finding
longitudinal
patterns
,
information
retrieval
in
medical
literature
,
and
integration
of
different
types
of
data
.

There
is
vast
potential
for
applying
pattern
recognition
techniques
including
algorithms
from
data
mining
,
machine
learning
,
statistical
analysis
,
and
matrix
-
based
methods
such
as
singular
value
decomposition
and
spectral
analysis
in
healthcare
data
.

In
this
section
we
first
provide
an
overview
of
some
of
the
common
methods
that
have
been
developed
in
the
recent
literature
and
then
describe
a
few
articles
in
more
details
.

In
our
discussion
we
recognize
the
overlap
between
machine
learning
and
data
mining
methods
but
differentiate
the
two
fields
by
the
fact
that
data
mining
has
a
more
explicit
focus
on
dealing
with
large
databases
.

Statistical
methods
are
hypothetico
-
deductive
where
the
main
focus
is
to
test
and
either
validate
or
refute
,
through
rigorous
mathematical
treatment
,
a

hypothesis

This

People
learn
and
induce
from
prior
experiences
.

We
first
learn
how
to
use
a
spoon
and
then
know

We
first

.

Transferring
knowledge
from
one
situation
to
another
related
situation
often
increases
the
speed
and
quality
of
learning
.

This
observation
is
relevant
to
human
learning
,
as
well
as
machine
learning
.

This
thesis
focuses
on
the
problem
of
knowledge
transfer
in
the
context
of
machine
learning
and
information
science
.

The
goal
of
knowledge
transfer
is
to
train
a
system
to
recognize
and
apply
knowledge
acquired
from
previous
tasks
to
new
tasks
or
new
domains
.

An
effective
knowledge
transfer
system
facilitates
the
learning
processes
for
novel
tasks
,
where
little
information
is
available
.

For
example
,
the
ability
to
transfer
knowledge
from
a
model
that
identifies
writers
born
in
the
U.S.
to
identify
writers
born
in
Kiribati
,
a
much
lesser
known
country
,
would
increase
the
speed
of
learning
to
identify
writers
born
in
Kiribati
from
scratch
.

In
this
thesis
,
we
investigate
three
dimensions
of
knowledge
transfer
:
what
,
how
,
and
why
.

We
present
and
elaborate
on
these
questions
:
What
type
of
knowledge
should
we
transfer
?

How
should
we
transfer
knowledge
across
entities
?

Why
do
we
observe
certain
pattern
of
knowledge
transfer
?

We
first
propose
Segmented
Transfer
a
novel
knowledge
transfer
model
to
identify
and
learn
from
the
most
informative
partitions
from
prior
tasks

apply
the
proposed
model
to
the
problem
of

and

search

The

with
an
emphasis
on
automatically
assessing
discussion
activities
and
promoting
student
discussion
participation
and

.

In
this
paper
,
we
present
a
discussion
scaffolding
tool
that
exploits
natural
language
processing
and
information
retrieval
techniques
.

The
PedaBot
tool
is
designed
to
aid
student
knowledge
acquisition
,
promote
reflection
about
course
topics
and
encourage
student
participation
in
discussions
.

It
dynamically
processes
student
discussions
and
presents
related
discussions
and
document
from
a
knowledge
base
of
past
discussions
and
course
materials
.

This
paper
describes
the
system
and
presents
a
comparative
analysis
of
the
information
retrieval
techniques
used
to
respond
to
free
-
form
student
discussions
,
including
a
combination
of
topic
profiling
,
term
frequency
-
inverse
document
frequency
,
and
latent
semantic
analysis
.

Responses
are
presented
as
annotated
links
that
students
can
follow
and
rate
for
usefulness
.

The
tool
has
been
integrated
into
a
live
discussion
board
and
has
been
used
by
an
undergraduate
computer
science
course
for
three
semesters
.

We
report
current
studies
of
PedaBot
from
its
usages
based
on
student
viewings
,
student
ratings
,
and
a
small
survey
.

Initial
results
indicate
that
there
is
a
high
level
of
student
interest
in
the
feature
and
that
its
responses
are
moderately
relevant
to
student
discussions
.

We
are
exploring
more
opportunities
to
exposing
the
tool
to
students

BACKGROUND
Millions
of
consumers
perform
health
information
retrieval
(
HIR
)
online
.

To
better
understand
the
consumers
'
perspective
on
HIR
performance
,
we
conducted
an
observation
and
interview
study
of
97
health
information
consumers
.

METHODS
Consumers
were
asked
to
perform
HIR
tasks
and
we
recorded
their
view
regarding
performance
using
several
differ
-
ent
subjective
measurements
:
finding
the
desired
information
,
usefulness
of
the
information
found
,
satisfaction
with
the
information
,
and
intention
to
continue
searching
.

Statistical
analysis
was
applied
to
verify
if
the
multiple
subjective
measurements
were
redundant
.

The
measurements
ranged
from
slight
agreement
to
no
agreement
among
them
.

A
number
of
reasons
were
identified
for
this
lack
of
agreement
.

Although
related
,
the
four
subjective
measurements
of
HIR
performance
are
distinct
from
each
other
and
carried
different
useful
information

Open

question
answering
has
become
a
very
active

area
over
the
past
few
years
,
due
in
large
measure
to
the
stimulus
of
the

This

addresses
the

This
task
stands
in
contrast
to
the
more
conventional
IR
task
of
retrieving
<
b

relevant
to
a

,
where
the

may
be
simply
a

The
promise
of
the
Semantic
Web
is
to
democratise
access
to
data
,
allowing
anyone
to
make
use
of
and
contribute
back
to
the
global
store
of
knowledge
.

Within
the
scope
of
the
OMRAS2Music
Information
Retrieval
project
,
we
have
made
use
of
and
contributed
to
Semantic
Web
technologies
for
purposes
ranging
from
the
publication
of
music
recording
metadata
to
the
online
dissemination
of
results
from
audio
analysis
algorithms
.

In
this
paper
,
we
assess
the
extent
to
which
our
tools
and
frameworks
can
assist
in
research
and
facilitate
distributed
work
among
audio
and
music
researchers
,
and
enumerate
and
motivate
further
steps
to
improve
collaborative
efforts
in
music
informatics
using
the
Semantic
Web
.

To
this
end
,
we
review
some
of
the
tools
developed
by
the
OMRAS2
project
,
examine
the
extent
to
which
our
work
reflects
the
Semantic
Web
paradigm
,
and
discuss
some
of
the
remaining
work
needed
to
fulfil
the
promise
of
online
music

At
the
time
when
the
IANI
facility
was
developed
there
was
an
increasing
demand
for
easy
and
uniform
access
to
online
databases
.

The
major
online
search
services
have
traditionally
been
available
through
command
-
mode
interfaces
.

Attempts
to
provide
simplifi
ed
end
user
interfaces
emerged
in
the
1980
́s
.

In
the
mid
eighties
the
technical
development
brought
personal
computers
with
communication
capabilities
into
the
work
place
and
many
users
were
able
to
access
online
databases
all
over
the
world
.

By
the
start
of
the
IANI
project
the
total
number
of
publicly
available
online
databases
was
about
3400
(
1

In
1987
the
directory
of
online
databases
in
the
Nordic
countries
contained
over
300
databases
on
almost
150
hosts
.

These
databases
were
small
and
specialized
and
were
used
very
little
.

Half
of
them
were
reference
databases
,
the
rest
of
them
were
factual
and
full
text
databases
2
)

They
were
in
different
languages
and
they
displayed
a
variety
of
different
database
structures
,
search
languages
and
login
procedures
.

Many
did
not
ever
have
a
database
structure
and
their
documentation
was
often
non
-
existent.(3

Little
is
known
about
how
people
,
contexts
,
and
tools
impact
decisions
to
use
a
Knowledge
Management
System
(
KMS
The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
better
understand
information
retrieval
when
solving
difficult
problems
.

Key
research
questions
focused
on
social
structure
,
interpersonal
relationships
,
and
nature
of
the
KMS
.

In
this
sequential
exploratory
study
,
semi
-
structured
interviews
were
conducted
and
surveys
were
distributed
to
a
purposive
sample
of
299
technology
support
personnel
in
a
large
accounting
firm
.

Thematic
analysis
was
applied
against
interview
outcomes
,
and
survey
responses
were
analyzed
using
ANOVA
and
confirmed
with
the
KruskalWallis
test
.

Social
structure
analysis
showed
fewer
structural
holes
within
networks
among
routine
KMS
users
.

Contrary
to
social
resource
theory
,
information
was
rarely
sought
from
supervisors
.

Reciprocal
information
exchange
accompanied
asking
for
help
,
but
not
when
information
was
retrieved
from
the
KMS
.

In
addition
,
formal
designation
of
experts
,
electronic
instant
messaging
(
IM
and
KMS
minimized
the
impact
of
geographic
disparity
.

The
KMS
facilitated
the
distribution
of
information
and
enabled
learning
but
was
not
uniformly
adopted
.

Recommendations
for
practice
include
the
strategic
designation
of
experts
and
refinement
of
mechanisms
available
for
information
retrieval
.

Information
Retrieval
(
IR
)
was
founded
soon
after
the
construction
of
the
first
computers
and
,
as
such
,
is
certainly
the
oldest
application
of
computer
science
to
the
problem
of
accessing
digitalized
documents
.

About
sixty
years
later
and
twenty
years
after
the
Internet
revolution
and
its
billions
of
pages
on
the
Web
IR
is
even
more
in
the
air
.

The
domain
was
for
a
long
time
restricted
to
non
interactive
applications
where
the
user
had
to
submit
his
information
needs
to
expert
intermediaries
in
the
so
-
called
automated
documentation
and
who
were
the
only
ones
having
access
to
the
retrieval
system
.

Of
course
the
domain
is
by
now
entirely
aimed
towards
interactive
information
retrieval
,
an
approach
based
on
tight
collaboration
between
users
and
the
search
engine
in
environments
able
to
take
into
account
the
particular
search
situations
to
improve

a
history
of

with

of

Cutwidth
minimization
problem
(
CMP
)
consists
of
finding
a
linear
layout
of
a
graph
such
that
the
maximal
number
of
cuts
of
a
line
separating
consecutive
vertices
is
minimized
.

CMP
has
significant
applications
in
VLSI
design
,
network
communications
,
automatic
graph
drawings
and
information
retrieval
but
it
is
proven
to
be
a
NP
hard
problem
.

Exact
results
of
cutwidth
are
known
for
some
classes
of
graphs
but
no
algorithm
has
been
proposed
for
the
general
graphs
.

In
this
paper
,
we
present
a
hybrid
evolutionary
algorithm
(
HEA
)
for
CMP
which
uses
the
depth
first
search
of
graph
to
generate
the
initial
population
and
incorporates
the
simulated
annealing
in
the
selection
process
.

HEA
achieves
the
known
optimal
cutwidth
of
all
the
standard
graphs
tested
.

We
also
conjecture
the
cutwidth
of
some
circulant
graphs
and
generalized
Peterson
graphs
supported
by
our
experimental

Duplicate
and
near
duplicate
web
pages
are
stopping
the
process
of
search
engine
.

As
a
consequence
of
duplicate
and
near
duplicates
,
the
common
issue
for
the
search
engines
is
raising
the
indexed
storage
pages
.

This
high
storage
memory
will
slow
down
the
process
which
automatically
increases
the
serving
cost
.

Finally
,
the
duplication
will
be
raised
while
gathering
the
required
data
from
the
various
sources
based
on
the
user
’s
query
.

The
duplication
will
definitely
slow
down
the
information
retrieval
process
.

Duplication
is
nothing
but
the
similar
content
or
documents
located
under
various
sites
.

Content
duplication
can
be
taken
place
at
different
forms
and
levels
such
as
exact
document
copy
,
paragraph
copy
,
sentence
copy
,
single
word
changes
and
sentence
structure
changes
.

Duplication
detection
is
the
process
of
identifying
the
multiple
representations
of
a
same
real
world
object
.

In
this
paper
,
the
content
duplication
is
identified
using
two

(
2D
)
text
matrix
approach
.

By
using

In
this
paper
we
describe
some
requirements
which
an
ideal
geographic
information
system
(
GIS
)
must
meet
to
cope
with
the
challenges
of
the
future
.

We
look
at
data
modelling
,
the
integration
of
geographic
information
science
and
photogrammetry
,
update
and
refinement
of
a
geospatial
database
,
and
data
integration
.

We
claim
that
data
modelling
needs
to
be
carried
out
in
3D
based
on
a
topologic
data
structure
with
the
possibility
for
incorporating
change
.

Photogrammetric
operations
such
as
the
generation
of
digital
terrain
models
or
the
manual
and
automatic
acquisition
of
vector
data
from
imagery
should
be
considered
as
modules
of
future
GIS
,
which
should
also
have
efficient
mechanisms
for
incremental
updating
and
versioning
.

Finally
,
the
integration
of
all
types
of
data
should
be
possible
,
e.g.
various
vector
data
sets
as
well
as
DTMs
and
images
.

We
illustrate
the
requirements
with
the
help
of
three
examples
,
one
describing
data
acquisition
and
modelling
in
an
interdisciplinary
project
,
one
dealing
with
quality
control
and
update
using
imagery
,
and
the
last
one
presenting
an
algorithm
for
the
integration
of
a
2D
data
set
and
a
DTM
.

While
we
believe
that
the
discussed
requirements
are
vital
for
the
development
of
GIS
we
are
aware
of
the
fact
that
other
issues
such
as
database
design
,
visualisation
,
and
geospatial
infrastructure
not
discussed
in
this
paper
,
are
of
similar
importance
for
the
field
.

After
many
years
building
the
foundation
of
the
digital
library
,
information
retrieval
has
emerged
from
its
roots
in
bibliographic
retrieval
to
establish
its
role
in
hypertext
and
Web
applications
.

We
are
now
in
the
midst
of
a
“
seismic
”
shift
of
digital
content
and
context
from
the
global
repository
[
i.e
memex
(
Bush
,
1945
through
docuverse
(
Nelson
,
1981
)
to
the
global
resource
.

From
a
repository
of
archived
documents
with
embedded
links
we
have
seen
the
emergence
of
CGI
,
JavaScript
,
Java
,
ActiveX
,
and
XML
,
all
tuned
to
providing
dynamic
and
application
oriented
use
of
information
resources
.

The
digital
library
is
merging
with
the
digital
workplace
and
the
digital
marketplace
.

Many
of
the
“
documents
”
retrieved
are
virtual
documents
.

That
is
they
are
created
on
the
way
to
the
user
rather
than
copied
from
a
digital
repository
.

This
has
a
significant
impact
on
the
notion
of
information
storage
and
retrieval
.

What
does
it
mean
to
search
nonrepository
data
?

How
is
information
authenticated
or
referenced
when
it
comes
from
different
sources
and
processes
?

Who
owns
it
?

Although
the
wide
availability
of
Web
resources
makes
this
problem
obvious
,
it
is
not
restricted
to
the
Web
.

to
report
a

application
that
leads
to
the
constitution
of
a
benchmark
such
as
those
that
exist
in

evaluations
.

This
benchmark
enables
to
perform
quantitative
evaluation
by
classic
metrics
such
as
precision
and
recall
.

We
had
also
conducted
a
qualitative

The
system
implements
the
retrieval
of
Mongolian

Firstly
,
in

,
we
built
a
Mongolian
corpus
with
one
million
words
,
which
has
been
corrected
manually
.

Secondly
,
after
being
transcoded
,
theses
data
was
represented
by
Latin
characters
.

Finally
,
we
used
Solr
to
build
indexes
and
documents
so
that
we
do
queries
on
millions
of

Complex

are
used
in
many
environments

Such

contain

.

Powerful

are
needed
to
facilitate
their

Existing
IR

are
poor
in
com

However
,
in

,
IR

users
would
often
want
to
obtain

on
subdocuments
of
complex

.

In
this
paper
we
address
this
problem
and
provide
a
truly
declarative
and
powerful

for
the
users

Our
interface
is

Introduction

Although
geographic
information
systems
have
been
used
for
quite
a
while
(
Coppock
Rhind
1991
their
functionality
has
changed
only
little
over
the
years
.

In
spite
of
their
name
,
geographic
information
systems
have
so
far
been
mostly
geometric
in
nature
,
ignoring
the
temporal
,
thematic
,
and
qualitative
dimensions
of
geographic
features
(
Molenaar
1996
;
Sinton
1978
;
Usery
1996
There
are
numerous
attempts
to
overcome
these
limitations
.

For
example
,
a
variety
of
papers
(
Frank
1992
;
Goodchild

;
Gupta

Jain
1991

deal
with

of
the

,
while
Allen

its

;
Freksa
1990
;
Guesgen

form
the
basis
for
numerous
temporal

provide
examples
that
the
inherent
fuzziness
of
geographic
features
becomes
increasingly
acknowledged
in
geographic

science
as
well
.

In
many
geographic
information
systems
,
the
extraction
of
new
information
from
stored
spatial
data
is
achieved
through
map
overlap
.

New
maps
are
computed
from
existing
ones
by
applying
one
of
the
following
operations
:
Buffer
operations
,
which
increases
the
size
of
an
object
by
extending
its
boundary
.

Set
operations
,
such
as
complement
,
union
,
and
intersection
.

These
operations
are
exact
quantitative
operations
.

Humans
,
on
the
other
hand
,
often
prefer
a
vague
,
uncertain
,
or
qualitative
operation
over
an
exact
quantitative
one
.

For
example
,
instead
of
requesting
all

it

This
,
however
,
requires
some
kind
of
vague

uncertain

qualitative
buffer
operation
.

We
have
introduced
such
an
operation
,
together
with
other
similar
operations

in

papers

The

model
are
investigated
in
this
paper
,
from
which
we
know
the

Based
on

an

is
presented
by
taking
the
advantage
of
these

an

The

Incident
reporting
is
becoming
increasingly
important
in
large
organizations
.

Legislation
is
progressively
being
introduced
to
deal
with
this
information
.

One
example
is
the
European
Directive
No
.
94/95/EC
,
which
obliges
airlines
and
national
bodies
to
collect
and
collate
reports
of
incidents
.

Typically
these
organizations
use
manual
files
and
standard
databases
to
store
and
retrieve
incident
reports
.

However
,
research
has
established
that
database
technology
needs
to
be
enhanced
in
order
to
deal
with
incidents
.

This
paper
describes
the
design
and
implementation
of
InRet
,
an
incident
report
retrieval
system
that
endeavours
to
find
similarities
and
patterns
between
incidents
by
combining
the
strengths
of
Case

and
Information

techniques
in

that
it
is
possible

and
,
that

This

of

works
in

Much
information
is
hard
to
retrieve
because
the
need
to
do
so
was
not
foreseen
at
the
time
the
information
was
stored
.

This
problem
appears
hard
to
solve
with
the
aid
of
computers
.

However
,
research
in
the
area
of
autobiographical
memory
suggests
the
use
of
retrieval
cues
relating
to
the
kinds
of
activities
in
which
the
user
was
engaged
at
the
time
of
storage
.

These
are
highly
correlated
with
the
time
at
which
the
event
took
place
,
and
thus
can
be
used
for
indexing
,
taking
advantage
of
the
accurate
time
-
stamps
that
computers
usually
apply
automatically
when
information
is
stored
.

In
the
proposed
activity
-
based
retrieval
system
,
data
on
the
user
’s
activity
are
gathered
automatically
to
support
retrieval
by
,
for
example
,
browsing
through
an
‘
autobiography’
of
work
episodes
.

The
paper
discusses
some
of
the
difficulties
with
this
approach
,
and
presents
the
results
of
three
experiments
in
which
autobiographical
episodes
were
reconstructed
by
means
of
automatically
collected
activity
data
.

It
concludes
with
some
comments
on
the
technical
feasibility
and
social
acceptability
of
such
an
approach
to
information
retrieval
.

Recently
,
various
language

approaches
have
been
proposed
in
the
information
retrieval
realm
,
with
their
promising
performances
in
general
document
and
Web
page
retrieval
applications
.

Based
on
these
achievements
,
in
this
paper
,
we
investigate
and
discuss
whether
language
model
approaches
can
be
adapted
to
content

A
critical
element
of
language
model
estimation
is
smoothing
,
which
adjusts
the
maximum
likelihood
estimation
to
overcome
the
data
sparseness
problem
.

Therefore
,
we
perform
extensive
studies
over
different
smoothing
methods
,
strategies
,
and
parameters
,
by
showing
their
impacts
to
the

are
performed

two
popular

together
with
some
insightful
conclusions
to
facilitate
the
adaptation
of

Searching
for
relevant
information
on
the
worldwide
web
is
often
a
difficult
and
frustrating
task
.

The
information
one
is
looking
for
,
is
hidden
among
thousands
of
documents
returned
by
a
search
engine

One
way
of
making
search
for
relevant

easier
,
is
to
create
better
interfaces
to
the
search

interfaces
that

Ranking
of
relevant
objects
plays
an
important
role
in
various
applications
especially
in
multimedia
database
systems
and
information
retrieval
systems
.

In
contrast
to
traditional
database
systems
,
multimedia
database
systems
deal
with
similarity
queries
returning
a
list
of
objects
ranked
by
the
objects’
overall
score
.

The
overall
score
for
objects
in
the
database
is
calculated
using
a
scoring
rule
which
is
commonly
based
on
similarity
functions
and
fuzzy
logic
.

One
aspect
which
enhances
the
user
’s
flexibility
to
formulate
preferences
regarding
the
search
criteria
,
is
to
assign
weights
to
each
argument
in
a
query
.

In
this
paper
a
formal
specification
of
the
requirements
for
an
adequate
weighted
scoring
rule
is
given
.

Based
on
this
specification
different
methods
for
incorporating
weights
into
scoring
rules
are
evaluated
and
their
limitations
are
shown
.

Furthermore
,
we
discuss
that
weighting
on
different
levels
in
complex
queries
is
necessary
.

Therefore
,
multi
-
level
weighting
is
introduced
and
different
possibilities
to
assign
weights
on
different
levels
are
shown
.

Finally
,
an
extended

weighted
scoring
rules

In

This
algorithm
allows
a
formal
clustering
of
the

are
classified

The

we
improved
the
result
by
using
ontology

make
it

The
rapid
and
uncontrolled
growth
of
the
World
Wide
Web
(
WWW
)
imposes
severe
constraints
when
meeting
the
diverse
needs
of
today‘s
information
society
.

The
main
challenge
resides
on
:
location
,
retrieval
,
integration
and
coherent
presentation
of
quality
and
relevant
ubiquitous
information
(
anytime
,
anywhere
and
anyhow
with
the
correct
format
for
the
required
device
)
from
WWW
,
quickly
and
accurately
,
to
satisfy
a
user‘s
singular
information
needs
.

Taking
into
consideration
the
unique
features
of
the
WWW
environment
,
the
limitations
of
existing
solutions
and
the
fact
that
agents
are
efficient
tools
for
the

of
Web
Information

(
WIR
)
systems

offered
25
queries
(
topics
)
each
year
,
created
in
German
,
but
also
translated
into
English
and
Russian
.

Participating
groups
could
run
these
topics
:

either
as
monolingual
task
(
German
topics
)
against
the
76,000
German

In
addition
a
German

as
well
as

titles
have
been
available

In
2002
,
there
was
an
additional
distinct

corpus
to
test
system
performance
in
searching
a
multi

scientific
database
of
approximately
150,000
French
bibliographic
documents
.

As
additional
tool
a
controlled

GIRT
Task
in
CLEF
2003

In
the
CLEF
campaign
2003
the
GIRT
track
used
a
new
much
larger
collection
:
GIRT4
.

This
collection
of
German
social
science
data
contains
151,319
documents
and
is
available
as
two
pseudo
-
parallel
corpora
which
contain
the
same
documents
in
German
(
GIRT4-DE
)
and
in
English
(
GIRT4-EN
)

Again
the
topics
have
been
provided
in
German
,
English
and
Russian
language
.

Thus
,
in
the
CLEF
2003
campaign
it
was
possible
to
offer
two
monolingual
tasks
:
1
.
using
German
topics
against
German
data
,
2
.
using
English
topics
against
English
data
,
and
two
bilingual
tasks
:
1
.
using
English
or
Russian
topics
against
German
data
,
2
.
using
German
or
Russian
topics
against
English
data
.

The
same
controlled
vocabularies
in
German

English
and
German

Russian
as
in
the
previous
CLEF
campaigns
were
available

Usually
,
user
accesses
to
information
on
the
web
using
search
engines
.

However
,
a
significant
factor
,
which
is
the
quality
of
the
restored
documents
,
is
underestimated
by
most
of
these
engines
.

This
is
due
to
not
taking
into
account
all
dimensions
of
a
web
document
during
the
indexing
and
retrieval
process
.

In
recent
years
,
language
models
have
been
proposed
on
Information
Retrieval
and
increased
in
popularity
,
due
to
their
simplicity
,
clear
probabilistic
meaning
.

In
addition
these
models
offer
possibility
of
integrating
a
priori
document
information
.

Several
features
have
been
used
to
estimate
the
prior
probability
of
a
document
such
as
:
document
length
.

However
these
features
depend
only
on
the
document
.

A
web
page
is
part
of
website
.

The
idea
that
we
explore
in
this
article
is
to
use
website
features
which
contains
the
concerned
page
to
estimate
the
page

of

methods
in

In

of
its

in
various
applications
there
is
little

In

that

(
or

When
an
arbitrary

is
used
,
it
makes
at

(
n
k

mistakes
to
search
for
the
same
collection
of

.

The
linear
lower

are
independent
of
the
choices
of
the
threshold
and
coefficients
that
the

may
use
in
updating
its

Local
search
is
increasingly
attracting
more
demand
,
whereby
the
users
are
interested
to
find
out
about
places
or
events
in
their
local
vicinity
.

In
this
paper
,
we
propose
to
use
the
Twitter
microblogging
platform
to
detect
and
rank
local
events
of
interest
in
real
-
time
.

We
present
a
novel
event
retrieval
framework
,
where
both
the
contents
of
the
tweets
and
the
volume
of
the
microblogging
activity
are
exploited
to
locate
an
event
happening
in
a
certain
area
within
a
city
that
matches
the
user
’s
interests
as
expressed
in
the
form
of
a
query
.

In
particular
,
the
framework
measures
unusual
microblogging
activities
in
a
certain
area
and
uses
that
as
an
indication
of
the
occurrence
of
an
event
which
is
then
used
by
the
ranking
function
.

Since
the
proposed
event
retrieval
task
is
a
new
Information
Retrieval
(
IR
)
task
,
we
devise
a
methodology
that
is
inspired
by
the
conceptually
similar
IR
problem
of
video
segmentation
to
thoroughly
evaluate
our
approach
.

Our
evaluation
is
conducted
on
a
set
of
tweets
collected
over
a
period
of
twelve
days
from
different
areas
of
London
,
as
well
as
two
sets
of
local
events
collected
within
the
same
period
using
crowdsourcing
and
local
news
sources
in
London
.

In
addition
to
new
insights
on
the
factors
that
influence
the
development
of
an
effective
event
ranking
model
,
our
empirical
results
show
the
promise
and
effectiveness
of
our
proposed
approach
in
identifying
and
ranking
local
events

Evaluation
is
a
central
aspect
of
information
retrieval
(
IR
)
research
.

In
the
past
few
years
,
a
new
evaluation
methodology
known
as
living

has
been
proposed
as
a
way
for
researchers
to
be
able
to
perform
in

evaluation
.

The
first
CIKM
workshop
on
Living

for
IR
evaluation
(
LL’13
)
was
held
on
1st
November
2013

Multilingual
information
access
and
retrieval
is
a
specific
area
of
the
academic
domain
of
information
access
and
retrieval
;
the
main
focus
is
the
development
of
systems
for
information
discovery
in
multiple
languages
,
both
monolingually
and
across
languages
.

There
is
both
a
social
and
an
economic
need
for
such
systems
and
there
is
ample
evidence
that
this
need
will
grow
substantially
over
the
coming
years
.

In
this
introduction
,
we
describe
the
range
and
intentions
of
research
and
development
in
this
area
from
its
recognition
as
an
independent
discipline
in
the
mid-1990s
to
the
challenges
that
it
is
now
facing
today
.

The
Growth
of
the
Digital
Universe

The
term
‘
global
information
society’
is
often
used
to
describe
the
environment
in
which
we
live
at
the
beginning
of
the
twenty
-
first
century
,
the
term
meaning
different
things
to
different
people
.

Generally
speaking
,
there
is
agreement
that
there
is
an
ever
greater
amount
of
information
at
one
’s
disposal
.

The
major
sources
of
knowledge
and
reference
are
increasingly
digital
.

As
a
result
of
the
diffusion
of
the
Internet
and
the
World
Wide
Web
,
vital
information
has
never
before
been
this
available
to
an
increasingly
wider
public
,
breaking
a
former
‘
information
monopoly’
of
select
circles
.

If
this
information
is
successfully
made
accessible
,
it
has
the
power
to
transform
society
in
a
profound
way
.

However
,
a
major
obstacle
to
the
worldwide
dissemination
and
access
to
information
is
the
boundary
posed
by
language
diversity
.

Information
is
published
digitally
every
day
in
a
myriad
of
the
world
’s
languages
.

The
challenge
is
to

tools
that

networks
to
find
,
retrieve
and
understand
information
of
interest
in
whatever
language
it
has
been
stored
.

At
the
beginning
this
was
not
an
apparent
problem
.

The
first
websites
were
almost
entirely
dedicated
to
provision
of
information
in
English
and
the
first
search
services
in
the
mid-1990s
(
e.g
Lycos
,
AltaVista
,
Yahoo
were
implemented
to
meet
the
needs
of
an
English
-
speaking
community
.

The
users
of
these
services
had
mainly
academic
backgrounds
and
had
sufficient
English
language
skills
to
formulate
meaningful
queries
in
English
and
to
understand
the
documents
retrieved
.

However
,
in
the
last
few
years
of
the
twentieth
century
,
the
World
Wide
Web
expanded
rapidly
in
the
more
highly
developed
countries
reaching
a
mass
audience
and
impacting
on
many
aspects
of
daily
life
,
changing
the
ways
people
communicate
,
shop
and
plan
travel
.

From
this
moment
on
,
the
percentage
of
English
content
started
to
decline
and
monolingual
search
services
began
to
be
available
in
some
of
the
major
languages
.

Nowadays
,
in
the
twenty
-
first
century
,
the
Internet
and
the
World
Wide
Web
are
used
throughout
the
world
for
communication
,
business
and
leisure
activities
,
and
the
dissemination
of
information
,
and
the
number
of
languages
in
which
electronically
accessible
material
is
available
is
in
continual
growth
.

Tables
1.1
and
1.2
give
a
good
idea
of
the
growth
of
the
digital
universe
in
the
first
decade
of
this
millennium
.

Table
1.1
shows
that
while
the
percentage
of
the
population
that
uses
the
Internet
is
still
much
higher
in
the
more
developed
parts
of
the
globe
(
North
America
,
Australasia
and
Europe
there
was
a
very
strong
spurt
of
growth
in
the
period
2000–2010
in
the
lesser
developed
regions
.

This
trend
is
expected
to
continue
.

While
Table
1.1
shows
where
and
to
what
extent
the
Internet
is
being
used
globally
,
Table
1.2
lists
the
ten
most
used
languages
on
the
Web
as
of
2010
.

Although
English
still
maintains
an
important
position
as
a
‘
global’
language
,
the
table
shows
that
the
number
of
internet
users
speaking
Chinese
has
grown
more
than
a
1,000-fold
in
the
period
2000–2010
.

Judging
from
this
trend
,
within
a
few
years
Chinese
will
be
the
predominant
web
language
,
both
for
users
and
for
content
.

The
2,500
%
growth
of
Arabic
in
the
same
period
is
similarly
impressive
and
indicative
of
future
trends
.

From
these
tables
,
it
is
clear
that
the
position
of
English
as
the
dominant
language
is
declining
and
the
Web
is
becoming
a
truly
global
information
resource
.

The
question
is
:
How
much
information
is
lost
or
remains
hidden
because
it
is
1

In
this
period
,
an
increasing
proportion
of
new
users
coming
online
were
individuals
and
small
businesses
chiefly
interested
in
using
the
Internet
for
local
communication
.

In
non
-
English
speaking
countries
,
large
firms
or
public
institutions
may
have
an
incentive
to
also
post
their
web
pages
in
English
,
but
a
small
local
business
does
not
.

As
more
people
in
a
language
community
come
online
,
content
and
service
providers
have
a
strong
interest
in
accommodating
them
in
their
own
language
.

In
2009
at
the
Gartner
Symposium

Future
Information
Retrieval
,
especially
in
connection
with
the
internet
,
will
incorporate
the
content
descriptions
that
are
generated
with
social
network
extraction
technologies
and
preferably
incorporate
the
probability
theory
for
assigning
the
semantic
.

Although
there
is
an
increasing
interest
about
social
network
extraction
,
but
a
little
of
them
has
a
significant
impact
to
information
retrieval
.

Therefore
this
paper
proposes
a
model
of
information
retrieval
from
the
social
network
extraction
.

Nowadays
,
large
amount
of
data
is
available
everywhere
.

Therefore
,
it
is
very
important
to
analyze
this
data
in
order
to
extract
some
useful
information
and
to
develop
an
algorithm
based
on
this
analysis
.

This
can
be
achieved
through
data
mining
and
machine
learning
.

Machine
learning
is
an
integral
part
of
artificial
intelligence
,
which
is
used
to
design
algorithms
based
on
the
data
trends
and
historical
relationships
between
data
.

Machine
learning
is
used
in
various
fields
such
as
bioinformatics
,
intrusion
detection
,
Information
retrieval
,
game
playing
,
marketing
,
malware
detection
,
image
deconvolution
and
so
on
.

paper
presents
the
work
done
by
various

in
the
field
of
machine

various

The
performance
of
an
IR
system
is
deteriorated
by
factors
including
short
and
vague
queries
put
up
by
the
users
,
ever
increasing
volume
of
documents
on
the
web
,
users
not
knowing
their
exact
information
need
etc
.

Relevance
feedback
(
RF
)
and
web
search
document
clustering
are
techniques
to
improve
the
performance
of
an
Information
Retrieval
(
IR
)
system
.

Relevance
feedback
provides
a
method
to
get
more
relevant
search
result
from
an
IR
system
using
documents
that
are
marked
relevant
by
the
user
as
a
feedback
to
reformulate
query
.

This
refined
query
is
then
used
to
retrieve
the
documents
.

In
document
clustering
approach
,
the
search
result
is
divided
into
thematic
groups
where
documents
of
one
group
are
similar
to
each
other
and
dissimilar
to
the
documents
of
other
groups
.

This
paper
presents
a
report
on
the
effectiveness
of
relevance
feedback
technique
as
compared
to
document
clustering
in
context
of
web
information
retrieval
and
why
document
clustering
is
the
most
preferred
approach
.

The
standard
approach
for
term
frequency
normalization
is
based
only
on
the
document
length
.

However
,
it
does
not
distinguish
the
verbosity
from
the
scope
,
these
being
the
two
main
factors
determining
the
document
length
.

Because
the
verbosity
and
scope
have
largely
different
effects
on
the
increase
in
term
frequency
,
the
standard
approach
can
easily
suffer
from
insufficient
or
excessive
penalization
depending
on
the
specific
type
of
long
document
.

To
overcome
these
problems
,
this
article
proposes
two
-
stage
normalization
by
performing
verbosity
and
scope
normalization
separately
,
and
by
employing
different
penalization
functions
.

In
verbosity
normalization
,
each
document
is
prenormalized
by
dividing
the
term
frequency
by
the
verbosity
of
the
document
.

In
scope
normalization
,
an
existing
retrieval
model
is
applied
in
a
straightforward
manner
to
the
prenormalized
document
,
finally
leading
us
to
formulate
our
proposed
verbosity
normalized
(
VN
)
retrieval
model
.

Experimental
results
carried
out
on
standard
TREC
collections
demonstrate
that
the
VN
model
leads
to
marginal
but
statistically
significant
improvements
over
standard
retrieval
models
.

It
has
been
shown
that
the
use
of
topic
models
for
Information
retrieval
provides
an
increase
in
precision
when
used
in
the
appropriate
form
.

Latent
Dirichlet
Allocation
(
LDA
)
is
a
generative
topic
model
that
allows
us
to
model
documents
using
a
Dirichlet
prior
.

Using
this
topic
model
,
we
are
able
to
obtain
a
fitted
Dirichlet
parameter
that
provides
the
maximum
likelihood
for
the
document
set
.

In
this
article
,
we
examine
the
sensitivity
of
LDA
with
respect
to
the
Dirichlet
parameter
when
used
for
Information
retrieval
.

We
compare
the
topic
model
computation
times
,
storage
requirements
and
retrieval
precision
of
fitted
LDA
to
LDA
with
a
uniform
Dirichlet
prior
.

The
results
show
there
there
is
no
significant
benefit
of
using
fitted
LDA
over
the
LDA
with
a
constant
Dirichlet
parameter
,
hence
showing
that
LDA
is
insensitive
with
respect
to
the
Dirichlet
parameter
when
used
for
Information
retrieval
.

Despite
an
increased
amount
of
technologies
and
systems
designed
to
address
the
navigational
requirements
of
the
visually
impaired
community
of
approximately
7.4
million
in
Europe
,
current
research
has
failed
to
sufficiently
address
the
human
issues
associated
to
their
design
and
use
.

As
more
types
of
sensing
technologies
are
developed
to
facilitate
visually
impaired
travellers
for
different
navigational
purposes
(
local
vs.
distant
and
indoor
vs.
outdoor
an
effective
process
of
synchronisation
is
required
.

This
synchronisation
is
represented
through
context
-
aware
computing
,
which
allows
contextual
information
to
not
just
be
sensed
(
like
most
current
wayfinding
systems
but
also
adapted
,
discovered
and
augmented
.

In
this
paper
,
three
user
studies
concerning
the
suitability
of
different
types
of
navigational
information
for
visually
impaired
and
sighted
people
are
described
.

For
such
systems
to
be
effective
,
human
cognitive
maps
,
models
and
intentions
need
to
be
the
focus
of
further
research
,
in
order
to
provide
information
that
is
tailored
to
a
user
’s
task
,
situation
or
environment
.

Methodologies
aimed
at
establishing
these
issues
need
to
be
demonstrated
through
a
multidisciplinary
framework
.

INTRODUCTION

It
is
estimated
that
7.4
million
people
in
Europe
are
visually
impaired
(
1
Enhancing
and
maintaining
the
independence
of
this
community
has
in
recent
years
caused
an
escalation
of
research
and
development
into
orientation
and
wayfinding
technologies
.

For
instance
,
ETAs
(
Electronic
Travel
Aids
such
as
obstacle
avoidance
systems
(
e.g.
Laser
Cane
,
Kay
(
2
and
ultrasonic
obstacle
avoiders
have
been
developed
to
assist
visually
impaired
travellers
through
the
immediate
or
local
environment
.

Whereas
,
navigation
through
the
distant
environment
has
been
addressed
by
Global
Positioning
Systems
(
GPS
)
and
Geographical
Information
Systems
(
GIS
e.g.
the
MOBIC
Travel
Aid
(
Strothotte
et
al
(
3
Radio
Frequency
(
RF
)
beacons
have
also
been
used
to
provide
assistance
for
both
local
and
distant
navigation
,
as
well
as
for
navigation
through
outdoor
and
indoor
environments
(
Kemmerling
Schliepkorte
(

Other
indoor
technologies
which
depend
on
relative
positioning
include
sensors
such
as
digital
tags
,
active
badge
,
accelerometers
,
temperature
and
photodiodes
.

By
enriching
the
visually
impaired
traveller
’s
knowledge
of
the
local
and
more
distant
environment
,
these
technologies
have
the
potential
to
facilitate
them
to
unknown
destinations
along
unfamiliar
routes
which
,
until
now
,
has
either
been
impossible
or
considerably
vexatious
and
problematic
.

These
technologies
discover
aspects
of
the
user
’s
context
,
which
are
used
to
provide
feedback
on
navigational
assistance
or
obstacle
avoidance
.

However
,
these
are
usually
designed
specifically
for
local
or
distant
navigation
within
indoor
or
outdoor
environments
and
can
rarely
be
integrated
.

A
harmonisation
of
technologies
therefore
becomes
apparent
.

The
essence
of
‘
context
-
aware
computing’
exemplifies
this
concept
.

By
using
a
combination
of
technologies
,
which
discover
and
take
advantage
of
a
user
’s
context
,
a
context
-
aware
application
can
analyse
and
predict
what
information
might
be
relevant
and
useful
to
users
depending
on
their
task
,
situation
or
environment
,
thereby
minimising
the
need
for
traditional
user
-
interface
interaction
.

For
this
to
be
achieved
,
requires
an
understanding
of
what
dimensions
make
up
a
user
’s
context
,
in
particular
to
the
processes
involved
in
constructing
cognitive
maps
and
models
of
the
environment
(
an
issue
given
limited
appreciation
within
current
research
Despite
the
recent
technological
advancements
of
wayfinding
technologies
for
visually
impaired
people
,
there
is
still
a
lack
of
research

integrates
and
utilises

and

This

firstly
describes

of
our

concerning
the
suitability
of
different
types
of
navigational
information
for
visually

The

the

with
an
emphasis
on

for
meeting
the
requirements
of
the

community
.

PREVIOUS
RESEARCH
STUDIES

Our
first
two
studies
concerned
an
investigation
of
how
sighted
and
visually
people
describe
a
route
(
Bradley
Dunlop

,

This
provided
an
insight
into
how
people
use
clues
in
the
environment
to
help
them
navigate
and
orientate
.

Collectively
,
the
route
descriptions
from
each
participant
were
used
to
identify
eleven
categories
of
utterances
relating
to
the
environmental
context
:
directional
(
e.g.
left
,
right
structural
(
e.g.
road
,
monument
textual
-
structural
based
(
e.g.
Border
’s
bookshop
textual
-
area
/
street
based
(
e.g.
Sauchiehall
Street
environmental
(
e.g.
hill
,
river
numerical
(
e.g.
second
,
100
m
descriptive
(
e.g.
steep
,
tall
temporal
/
distance
based
(
e.g.
walk
until
you
reach
sensory
(
olfaction
/
hearing
/
touch
e.g.
sound
of
cars
passing
motion
(
e.g.
cars
passing
,
doors
opening
and
social
contact
(
e.g.
asking
people
or
using
a
guide
dog
for
help
Accumulated
tallies
were
solicited
for
each
contextual
category
across
each
participant
and
group
.

Both
sighted
and
visually
impaired
participants
varied
within
and
between
groups
.

Within
the
sighted
group
,
younger
participants
used
more
textual
-
structural
information
(
mainly
names
of
bars
,
restaurants
)
than
textual
area
/
street
information
,
whereas
this
trend
was
reversed
for
older
participants
.

Within
the
visually
impaired
group
,
there
were
differences
between
the
amount
of
local
and
distant
information
used
.

When
comparing
both
sighted
and
visually
impaired
groups
,
visually
impaired
people
used
considerably
more
contextual
information
generally
and
used
information
,
not
used
by
sighted
participants
,
within
sensory
,
motion
,
and
social
contact
categories
.

Our
third
study
involved
calculating
proportions
,
from
our
first
two
studies
,
of
information
used
across
all
contextual
categories
for
each
group
.

These
were
used
to
design
two
sets
of
messages
,
which
were
presented
to
sighted
and
visually
impaired
participants
as
they
walked
to
four
predetermined
landmarks
.

Messages
given
to
two
of
the
landmarks
were
derived
from
sighted
participants
descriptions
(
i.e.
more
textual
-
structural
and
textual
-
area
street
information
whereas
visually
impaired
participants’
descriptions
were
used
to
give
messages
to
the
other
two
landmarks
(
i.e.
more
sensory
information
By
using
an
objective
and
subjective
assessment
,
it
emerged
that
visually
impaired
people
rated
their
mental
workload
lesser
when
presented
with
information
from
visually
impaired
participants’
descriptions
.

This
was
also
reflected
in
fewer
deviations
from
the
route
and
quicker
times
to
complete
those
stages
.

Sighted
participants
,
however
,
found
this
information
to
cause
a
higher
mental
workload
.

In
conjunction
to
the
three
user
studies
,
we
conducted
a
multidisciplinary
literature
review
on
the
notion
a
‘
context
specifically
in
relation
to
context
-
aware
applications
/
systems
.

Proposed
context
models
for
psychology
,
linguistics
and
communication
,
and
computer
science
,
combined
with
a
multidisciplinary
model
,
revealed
that
the
relationship
or
interaction
between
internal
(
e.g.
cognitive
maps
/
models
)
and
external
contexts
(
e.g.
other
people
,
mobile
device
,
etc
need
to
be
addressed
further
with
respect
to
how
they
influence
our
decisions
and
the
process
by
which
we
interact
with
our
environment
.

Temporal
changes
and
notions
of
relevancy
are
intrinsic
factors
in
this
understanding

in
full
papers

under
review

THE
REQUIRED
FOCUS
OF
FURTHER
RESEARCH
Context
-
aware
computing
offers
a
great
potential
to
visually
impaired
people
,
not
just
for
navigation
but
also
to
facilitate
them
for
other
potential
needs
or
requirements
(
informing
them
of
the
nearest
café
,
post
office
,
etc
To
illustrate
,
Pascoe
(
11
)
proposes
four
generic
categories
of
context
-
aware
capabilities
,
as
shown
below
(
a
description
of
how
they
could
apply
to
visually
impaired
people
is
presented
1
.

Contextual
sensing
:

The
context
-
aware
application
simply
detects
various
environmental
states
and
presents
them
to
the
user
.

A
GPS
receiver
,
for
instance
,
takes
in
a
location
,
compares
it
to
a
digital
map
,
and
then
informs
the
user
of
their
location
.

Contextual
adaptation
:
The
application
leverages
contextual
knowledge
by
adapting
its
behaviour
to
integrate
more
seamlessly
with
the
user
’s
environment
.

For
instance
,
by
linking
with
a
server
containing
locations
of
excavation
work
,
the
context
-
aware
system
could
adapt
the
original
route
path
in
order
to
navigate
around
potentially
problematic
areas
.

Contextual
resource
discovery
:

The
application
discovers
other
resources
within
the
same
context
as
itself
and
exploits
these
resources
while
they
remain
in
the
same
context
.

Bus
and
train
timetables
,
for
example
,
could
be
downloaded
and
then
used
to
inform
the
user
how
long
they
have
to
wait
for
the
next
bus
.

Contextual
augmentation
:
The
application
can
augment
the
environment
with
additional
information
.

Visually
impaired
travellers
,
for
instance
,
could
leave
messages
at
particular
locations
in
the
environment
for
other
visually
impaired
people
(
e.g.
information
about
potential
hazards
thereby
creating
a
community
of
users
sharing
personal
experiences
.

It
should
be
noted
that
current
wayfinding
technologies
and
systems
for
the
visually
impaired
largely
use
just
contextual
sensing
.

Context
-
awareness
therefore
extends
the
possibilities
that
could
be
made
available
,
allowing
applications
to
provide
more
useful
and
pertinent
information
.

Ultimately
,
however
,
context
-
aware
systems
will
only
be
useful
if
they
manage
information
derived
from
those
sensing
technologies
in
a
way
that
is
compatible
with
the
users
cognitive
map
,
model
and/or
intentions
.

Jonsson
(
12
for
instance
,
describes
how
we
develop
cognitive
maps
in
order
to
navigate
;
a
process
which
involves
encoding
the
location
,
attributes
and
orientation
of
landmarks
in
the
environment
using
a
variety
of
human
sensory
sources
(
i.e.
visual
,
olfaction
,
haptic
and
auditory
A
cognitive
map
,
however
,
for
one
particular
area
can
change
depending
on
the
(
i
)
time
of
day
(
i.e.
day
/
night
ii
)
season
(
e.g.
summer
vs.
winter
and
(
iii
)
direction
of
travel
(
travelling
the
same
route
forward
or
back

It
is
therefore
reasonable
to
assume
that
visually
impaired
people
would
develop
different
cognitive
maps
or
models
based
upon
additional
factors
such
as
differing
levels
of
sight
or
whether
they
are
adventitiously
or
congenitally
blind
.

Kitchen
(
8)
indicates
that
there
needs
to
be
‘
an
effective
and
reliable
assessment
of
the
spatial
knowledge
structures
(
or

CONCLUSIONS
Previous
research
,
coupled
with
the
findings
of
our
studies
,
suggest
that
more
HCI
research
is
required
into
how
human
variability
influences
usability
,
in
particular
how
differences
in
visual
impairment
affect
the
processes
by
which
knowledge
is
derived
from
the
environment
to
construct
cognitive
maps
/
models
and
consequently
how
this
affects
their
behaviour
or
interaction
with
the
environment
.

Technologies
must
be
used
to
sense
,
not
just
the
environment
,
but
also
both
the
user
’s
cognitive
context
and
the
interaction
of
both
external
and
cognitive
worlds
.

For
this
to
be
achieved
,
there
needs
to
be
an
amalgamation
of
sensors
which
are
actively
managed
through
context
-
aware
applications
;
the
design
of
which
must
be
a
filtered
through
a
multidisciplinary
framework
.

By
doing
so
,
context
-
aware
systems
will
facilitate
visually
impaired
people
through
unknown
territory,<lb
>
enriching
both
their
knowledge
of
the
environment
as
well
as
enhancing
their
independence
.

Abstract—
To
expand
ontology
meanings
,
an
effective
ontology
mapping
approach
is
needed
to
map
related
or
similar
knowledge
from
heterogeneous
sources
together
.

Especially
,
the
mapping
approach
also
can
be
applied
to
support
image
recognition
in
order
to
enhance
its
retrieval
information
.

In
this
paper
,
we
propose
the
ontology
mapping
with
back
propagation
method
to
learn
image
objects
,
and
link
to
their
personal
information
to
increase
the
completeness
of
user
inquiry
.

In
our
approach
,
we
adopt
the
multilayer
feed
-
forward
neural
network
couple
with
back
propagation
algorithm
to
learn
the
image
patterns
,
store
their
similarity
values
,
check
and
map
with
target
images
,
and
link
to
their
target
information
from
knowledge
domains
at
the
final
process
.

Our
experiments
clearly
present
the
accuracy
of
overall
testing
which
can
reach
to
81.3
%

Kuhlthau
's
model
of
Information
Search
Process
(
ISP
)
is
confirmed
by
many
researches
as
an
valid
framework
and
tool
in
library
and
information
science
.

Along
with
the
popularity
of
e
-
learning
system
,
information
seeking
behavior
has
been
changed
significantly
by
technologically
rich
information
environments
,
such
as
intranet
and
internet
.

By
categorizing
the
sources
of
information
,
therefore
,
this
paper
proposed
a
modified
version
of
Kuhlthau
's
model
of
ISP
for
integrated
learning
environment
.

The
modified
process
of
information
search
consists
of
six
-
stages
,
i.e
initiating
an
assigned
project
,
reaching
a
consensus
,
pre
-
experimenting
on
roadmap
,
compiling
inventory
,
learning
from
the
information
,
and
cycling
information
search
.

Based
on
the
educational
theory
of
interactivist
,
the
model
changes
information
search
behavior
in
tasks
requires
knowledge
,
skill
and
experience
.

The
modified
model
suggests
the
progress
of
feelings
,
thoughts
and
actions
.

The
model
proposed
exhibits
students
'
information
behavior
in
integrated
learning
environment
.

Mobile
agents
need
to
communicate
and
interact
with
each
other
to
perform
a
global
task
.

Coordination
models
deal
with
interactions
between
concurrent
entities
.

A
context
-
aware
objective
coordination
model
(
COCM
)
is
proposed
for
mobile
agent
applications
.

The
context
aware
coordination
model
transfers
interactions
between
agents
from
globally
coupling
interactions
to
locally
uncoupling
tuple
space
interactions
.

Programmable
tuple
space
is
introduced
to
solve
the
problems
of
context
related
coordination
because
of
mobility
and
data
heterogeneity
in
mobile
agent
systems
.

Furthermore
a
sample
system
on
information
retrieval
in
mobile
agent
applications
is
carried
out
to
evaluate
the
performance
of
the
proposed
model
.

The
introduction
of
Swedish
made
it
possible
for
Lexware
to
be
tested
for
the
first
time
in
CLEF
.

Lexware
is
a
natural
language
system
applied
in
an
information
retrieval
task
and
not
an
information
retrieval
systems
using
NLP
techniques
,
therefore
it
is
interesting
to
compare
its
results
with
other
less
odd
IR
systems
.

We
experience
that
separate
evaluation
of
document
description
and
query
building
would
provide
yet
better
testing
for
our
system
.

A
Natural

System
for
Swedish
Lexware
is
a
natural

system
applied
in
an
information
retrieval
task
and
not
an
information
retrieval
systems
using
NLP
techniques
,
like
e.g.
NLIR
[

It
can
be
considered
odd
also
among
natural

systems
,
if
the
latter
are
assumed
to

The
strength
of
the
system
is
its
rich
lexicon
and
the
possibility
to
expand
the
lexicon
with
external

origin
,
synonymy
,
components
for
complex

,
hyponymy
.

Content
words
are
categorized
into
about
100

There
are
also
supplementary
word

which
include
about
50

plus
basic

Lexware
in
Another
Information
Retrieval
Task
Lexware
has
been
extensively
tested
in
another
information
retrieval
task
.

The
library
of
the
Swedish
parliament
Riksdagsbiblioteket
,
designed
and
conducted
evaluation
of
software
that
could
supplement
or
even
substitute
manual
indexing
of
the
documents
of
the
parliament
.

The
task
is
to
select
proper
keywords
among
descriptors
in
a
thesaurus
specially
created
for
this
kind
of
documents
.

Information
Retrieval
is
the
activity
of
finding
documents
which
is
of
unstructured
nature
and
it
should
satisfy
user
's
information
needs
.

The
term
"
IR
"
refers
to
the
retrieval
of
unstructured
records
,
that
is
,
records
which
are
free
-
form
natural
language
text
.

There
are
various
models
for
weighting
terms
of
corpus
documents
and
query
terms
.

The
probabilistic
model
captures
the
IR
problem
using
a
probabilistic
framework
,
It
tries
to
find
the
probability
that
a
document
will
be
relevant
to
a
user
query
or
not
.

In
this
we
have
a
collection
of
user
query
,
and
there
is
an
ideal
answer
set
for
each
query
,
first
of
all
initial
set
of
documents
are
retrieved
from
the
corpus
or
collection
of
documents
.

User
inspects
these
documents
for
searching
the
relevant
documents
,
then
IR
system
use
this
information
to
find
the
description
to
get
the
ideal
answer
set
.

This
work
is
carried
out
to
analyze
and
evaluate
the
retrieval
effectiveness
of
various
probabilistic
models
with
use
of
new
data
set
i.e
FIRE
2011
.

The
experiments
were
performed
with
different
variants
of
probabilistic
models
.

Terrier
3.5
,
which
is
an
open
search
engine
was
used
for
all
experiments
and
evaluation
.

Our
result
shows
that
IFB2
model
gives
the
highest
precision
values
with
the
news

In
this

we
define
a
type
of
cohesive
subgroups
called
<
i

communities</i
in
hypergraphs
,
based
on
the
edge
connectivity
of
subhypergraphs
.

We
describe
a
simple
algorithm
for
the
construction
of
these
sets
and
show
,
based
on
examples
from
image
segmentation
and
information
retrieval
,
that
these
groups
may
be
useful
for
the
analysis
and
accessibility
of

Belgian
Information

.

The
focus
of
this

workshop
was
on
interaction
,
with
the
goal
of
facilitating
and
increasing
interaction
,
especially
within
the
local
research
community
,
and
between
industry
and
academia
.

The
scientific
program
included
demos
,
research

,
and
compressed
contributions
.

The
keynotes
by
Nick

User
interfaces
with
hierarchical
browsing
structures
have
proved
to
be
easy
to
use
.

They
are
usually
based
on
an
ontology
which
organizes
the
terms
of
the
domain
.

In
order
to
be
able
to
use
such
an
interface
the
user
should
be
able
to
adapt
the
hierarchical
structure
to
his
knowledge
,
his
mental
model
of
the
domain
and
his
vocabulary
.

For
that
reason
,
the
user
should
be
able
to
choose
his
preferred
knowledge
structure
by
switching
the
hierarchical
ontologies
.

Only
the
use
of
the
appropriate
terminology
guarantees
access
for
all
user
groups
.

This
paper
discusses
the
advantages
of
the
approach
and
the
necessary
underlying
transfer
relations
between
the
different
vocabularies
.

It
gives
a
practical
example
of
a
vague
relation
which
has
been
established
by
machine
learning
algorithms
between
two
library
catalogues
for
information
science
.

These
transfer
relations
can
be
exploited
for
the
implementation
of
a
virtual
library
shelf
where
the
distribution
of
books
over
the
shelves
is
not
fixed
but
flexible
.

A
change
of
the
hierarchical
system
results
in
an
automatic
re
-
organization
of
the
material
.

Extrapolations
are
techniques
in
linear
algebra
that
require
little
additional
infrastructure
that
must
be
incorporated
in
the
existing
query
-
dependent
Link
Analysis
Ranking
(
LAR
)
algorithms
.

Extrapolations
in
LAR
settings
relies
on
the
prior
knowledge
of
the
(
iterative
)
process
that
created
the
existing
data
points
(
iterates
)
to
compute
the
new
(
improved
)
data
point
,
which
periodically
leads
to
the
desired
solution
faster
than
the
original
method
.

In
this
study
,
the
author
presents
novel
approaches
using
extrapolation
techniques
to
speed
-
up
the
convergence
of
query
-
dependent
iterative
methods
,
link
analysis
based
ranking
methods
,
where
hyperlink
structures
are
used
to
determine
relative
importance
of
a
document
in
the
network
of
inter
-
connections
.

The
author
uses
the
framework
defined
in
HITS
and
SALSA
and
proposes
the
use
of
different
Extrapolation
techniques
for
faster
ranking
.

The
paper
improves
algorithms
like
HITS
and
SALSA
using
Extrapolation
techniques
.

With
the
proposed
approaches
it
is
possible
to
accelerate
the
iterative
ranking
algorithms
in
terms
of
reducing
the
number
of
iterations
and
increasing
the
rate
of
convergence

These

will
help
us
identify
the
proximity
and
relevance
of
documents
amongst
each
other
,
and
enables
us
to
find
out
the
social
or
informational
organization
of
the
documents
(
the
sociology
of
information
We
can
utilize
the
contextual
exposition
of
documents
to
deduce
the
importance
or
popularity
of
the
documents
in
the
network
,
by
using
the
core
graph
theory
concepts
and
techniques
.

The
citation
structures
of
the
documents
contain
a
wealth
of
useful
but
“
implicit
information
Through
citation
structure
hundreds
and
millions
of
documents
can
be
pulled
together
into
a
network
of
knowledge
.

Foremost
such
a
structure
represents
the
users’
behaviours
and
needs
.

Users
on
the
Web
usually
discover
most
relevant
and
valuable
information
through
the
recommendations
and
references
from
a
good
source
of
information
.

One
of
the
main
concerns
in
the
link
based
ranking
methods
is
the
convergence
to
a
“
good
solution
”
or
an
equilibrium
state
.

An
equilibrium
state
is
a
state
where
system
under
certain
presumptions
can
declare
the
set
of
good
results
corresponding
to
user
query
.

Most
of
the
link
analysis
based
ranking
models
are
iterative
in
nature
,
they
iteratively
move
towards
the
required
equilibrium
state
(
the
good
solution

Convergence
is
a
central
phenomenon
in
iterative
algorithms
(
Lay
,
1994

In
linear
algebra
,
the
iterative
methods
are
employed
when
direct
methods
would
be
prohibitively
expensive
and
in
some
cases
impossible
even
with
best
possible
computing
power
to
find
out
the
actual
solution
.

Essentially
the
iterative
methods
such
as
“
power
method
Lay
,
1994
)
provide
an
approximation
to
the
true
solution
starting
from
a
seed
value
.

This
work
deals
with
the
convergence
properties
and
behaviour
of
the
famous

is
the
improvements

in

We
have
distinctively
applied
extrapolation
techniques
to
query

LAR
algorithms
,
which
was
not
done
before

The
parameters
are
manipulated
extensively
in
the

evaluation
and
hence
extracted
a

due
to

the

with
an
extensive
experimental
evaluation

they
have
found
an
improvement

THEORETICAL
BACKGROUND
Link
Analysis
Ranking
(
LAR
)

The
presence
of
(
hyper
link
information
clearly
augmented
a
great
deal
to
the
characterization
of
the
informative
content
present
in
the
documents
.

LAR
approaches
are
intended
to
resolve
some
of
the
intrinsic
weaknesses
of
the
content
-
based
Information
Retrieval
(
IR
)
models
.

Through
the
analyses
of
network
of
the
documents
(
due
to
citation
structure
)

LAR
approaches
bring
in
a
whole
new
horizon
to
information
retrieval
space
.

The
essence
of
LAR
therefore
is
that
the
“
overall
information
”
of
a
hyperlink
database
of
documents
is
not
composed
of
only
static
“
textual
information
but
also
another
,
the
“
hyper

information
.

is
the
next

from

The
knowledge
gap
perspective
is
a
seminal
theory
of
mass
communication
effects
,
one
that
bears
wider
consideration
in
the
information
sciences
literature
,
particularly
as
converging
voice
,
video
and
data
channels
continue
to
converge
and
deliver
each
other
’s
services
.

Although
largely
rooted
in
studies
of
traditional
news
media
during
the
postmodern
era
,
these
gaps
in
audience
information
help
define
the
digital
divides
accompanying
the
diffusion
of
new
media
channels
.

Given
that
over
a
hundred
studies
have
investigated
the
knowledge
gap
—
including
several
meta
-
analyses
(
e.g
Gaziano
,
1996
;
Hwang
Jeong
,
2009
the
present
study
provides
further
conceptual
explication
via
a
narrative
review
of
the
knowledge
gap
literature
.

Yet
the
knowledge
gap
may
prove
to
be
an
important
theory
describing
current
phenomena
if
we
apply
it
in
an
environment
where
media
have
been
transformed
dramatically
,
where
individual
choice
and
control
have
increased
greatly
,
and
generational
differences
have
become
more
pronounced
.

After
providing
a
taxonomy
of
the
different
contexts
in
which
knowledge
gaps
can
be
explicated
,
the
essay
concludes
with
an
argument
for
moving
beyond
the
“
relativistic
”
arguments
and
considering
how
the
concepts
and
the
theory
may
be
useful
in
describing

The
conventional
boolean
retrieval
system
does
not
provide

output
because
it

we

address
important
mathematical
properties
to
affect

This
dissertation
addresses
two
problems
related
to
the
management
of
data
and
information
in
wide
-
area
distributed
systems
:
distributed
shared
state
and
peer
-
to
-
peer
information
retrieval
.

Distributed
applications
typically
resort
to
ad
-
hoc
protocols
built
on
top
of
remote
invocation
(
e.g
Sun
RPC
or
Java
RMI
)
to
maintain
the
coherence
and
consistency
of
shared
state
—
information
needed
at
more
than
one
site
.

We
instead
propose
to
automate
the
management
of
shared
state
.

As
a
complement
rather
than
a
replacement
to
remote
invocation
,
our
InterWeave
system
provides
a
unified
programming
environment
that
supports
the
use
of
shared
-
memory
programming
,
remote
invocation
,
relaxed
coherence
models
,
and
transactions
in
a
single
application
.

InterWeave
is
the
first
system
that
automates
the
typesafe
sharing
of
structured
data
in
its
internal
form
across
heterogeneous
platforms
and
multiple
languages
.

Our
evaluations
show
that
InterWeave
introduces
minimal
overhead
while
reducing
bandwidth
consumption
and
improving
performance
in
important
cases
.

Another
problem
we
study
in
this
dissertation
is
peer

peer
information

We
address
this

The
proliferation
of
electronically
available
networked
information
has
led
researchers
to
examine
the
issues
involved
in
developing
automated
methods
for
gathering
information
in
response
to
a
query
from
a
user
.

However
,
most
of
this
literature
deals
with
locating
,
gathering
and
selecting
the
best
response
to
a
query
from
among
a
multitude
of
responses
from
different
repositories
or
digital
libraries
.

This
paper
deals
with
a
different
model
of
response
to
a
query
,
involving
composition
of
mutually
related
partial
responses
spread
across
a
network
of
information
repositories
.

We
present
a
system
for
cooperative
retrieval
and
composition
of
a
case
in
which
subcases
are
distributed
across
different
agents
in
a
multi
-
agent
system
.

From
a
Gestalt
perspective
,
a
good
overall
case
may
not
be
the
one
derived
from
the
summation
of
best
subcases
.

Each
agent
’s
local
view
may
result
in
best
local
cases
,
which
when
assembled
may
not
result
in
the
best
overall
case
in
terms
of
global
measures
.

We
propose
a
negotiation
-
driven
case
retrieval
algorithm
as
an
approach
to
dynamically
resolving
inconsistencies
between
different
case
pieces
during
the
retrieval
process

In
this
paper
we
use
information
retrieval
metrics
to
evaluate
the
effect
of
a
document
sanitization
process
,
measuring
information
loss
and
risk
of
disclosure
.

In
order
to
sanitize
the
documents
we
have
developed
a
semiautomatic
anonymization
process
following
the
guidelines
of
Executive
Order
13526
(
2009
)
of
the
US
Administration
.

It
embodies
two
main
steps
i
)
identifying
and
anonymizing
specific
person
names
and
data
,
and
(
ii
)
concept
generalization
based
on
WordNet
categories
,
in
order
to
identify
words
categorized
as
classified
.

Finally
,
we
manually
revise
the
text
from
a
contextual
point
of
view
to
eliminate
complete
sentences
,
paragraphs
and
sections
,
where
necessary
.

For
empirical
tests
,
we
use
a
subset
of
the
Wikileaks
Cables
,
made
up
of
documents
relating
to
five
key
news
items
which
were
revealed
by

Given
an
entity
represented
by
a
single
node
q
in
semantic
knowledge
graph
D
,
the
Graphical
Entity
Summarisation
problem
(
GES
)
consists
in
selecting
out
of
D
a
very
small
surrounding
graph
S
that
constitutes
a
generic
summary
of
the
information
concerning
the
entity
q
with
given
limit
on
size
of
S.
This
article
concerns
the
role
of
diversity
in
this
quite
novel
problem
.

It
gives
an
overview
of
the
diversity
concept
in
information
retrieval
,
and
proposes
how
to
adapt
it
to
GES
.

A
measure
of
diversity
for
GES
,
called
ALC
,
is
defined
and
two
algorithms
presented
,
baseline
,
diversity
-
oblivious
PRECIS
and
diversity
-
aware
DIVERSUM
.

A
reported
experiment
shows
that
DIVERSUM
actually
achieves
higher
values
of
the
ALC
diversity
measure
than
PRECIS
.

Next
,
an
objective
evaluation
experiment
demonstrates
that
diversity
-
aware
algorithm
is
superior
to
the
diversity
-
oblivious
one
in
terms
of
fact
selection
.

More
precisely
,
DIVERSUM
clearly
achieves
higher
recall
than
PRECIS
on
ground
truth
reference
entity
summaries
extracted
from
Wikipedia
.

We
also
report
another
intrinsic
experiment
,
in
which
the
output
of
diversity
-
aware
algorithm
is
significantly
preferred
by
human
expert
evaluators
.

Importantly
,
the
user
feedback
clearly
indicates
that
the
notion
of
diversity
is
the
key
reason
for
the
preference
.

In
addition
,
the
experiment
is
repeated
twice
on
an
anonymous
sample
of
broad
population
of
Internet
users
by
means
of
a
crowd
-
sourcing
platform
,
that
further
confirms
the
results
mentioned

Web
search
that
utilizes
social
tagging
data
suffers
from
an
extreme
example
of
the
vocabulary
mismatch
problem
encountered
in
traditional
Information
Retrieval
(
IR

This
is
due
to
the
personalized
,
unrestricted
vocabulary
that
users
choose
to
describe
and
tag
each
resource
.

Previous
research
has
proposed
the
utilization
of
query
expansion
to
deal
with
search
in
this
rather
complicated
space
.

However
,
non
-
personalized
approaches
based
on
relevance
feedback
and
personalized
approaches
based
on
co
-
occurrence
statistics
have
only
demonstrated
limited
improvements
.

This
paper
proposes
an
Iterative
Personalized
Query
Expansion
Algorithm
for
Web
Search
(
iPAW
which
is
based
on
individual
user
profiles
mined
from
the
annotations
and
resources
the
user
has
marked
.

The
method
also
incorporates
a
user
model
constructed
from
a
cooccurrence
matrix
and
from
a
Tag
-
Topic
model
where
annotations
and
web
documents
are
connected
in
a
latent
graph
.

The
experimental
results
suggest
that
the
proposed
personalized
query
expansion
method
can
produce
better
results
than
both
the
classical
non
-
personalized
search
approach
and
other
personalized
query
expansion
methods
.

An
“
adaptivity

was
further
investigated
to

The
main
goal
of
this
paper
is
to
present
the
initial
version
of
a
Textile
Chemical
Ontology
,
to
be
used
by
textile
professionals
with
the
purpose
of
conceptualising
and
representing
the
banned
and
harmful
chemical
substances
that
are
forbidden
in
this
domain
.

After
analysing
different
methodologies
and
determining
that
“
Methontology
”
is
the
most
appropriate
for
the
purposes
,
this
methodology
is
explored
and
applied
to
the
domain
.

In
this
manner
,
an
initial
set
of
concepts
are
defined
,
together
with
their
hierarchy
and
the
relationships
between
them
.

This
paper
shows
the
benefits
of
using
the
ontology
through
a
real
use
case
in
the
context
of
Information
Retrieval
.

The
potentiality
of
the
proposed
ontology
in
this
preliminary
evaluation
encourages
extending
the
ontology
with
a
higher
number
of
concepts
and
relationships
,
and
validating
it
within
other
Natural
Language
Processing
applications

Key
terms
related
to
information
searching
and
search
models
are
defined
.

A
historic
context
is
provided
to
illustrate
the
evolution
of
the
four
main
digital
environments
that
users
interact
with
in
their
search
process
to
offer
readers
background
information
regarding
the
transition
from
manual
information
systems
to
computer
-
based
information
retrieval
(
IR
)
systems
,
as
well
as
the
transition
from
intermediary
searching
to
end
-
user
searching
.

Emphasis
is
placed
on
the
review
of
different
levels
of
information
searching
from
search
tactics
/
moves
,
search
strategies
,
and
usage
patterns
,
to
search
models
and
associated
factors
in
relation
to
task
,
user
knowledge
structure
,
IR
system
design
,
and
social
-
organization
context
.

Search
models
are
further
classified
into
two
types
,
with
one
type
illustrating
information
search
process
(
ISP
)
and
the
other
type
emphasizing
the
factors
that
influence
the
process
.

In
addition
,
unsolved
problems
and
future
research
are
discussed
and
suggested
.

The
effectiveness
of
queries
in
information
retrieval
can
be
improved
through
query
expansion
.

This
technique
automatically
introduces
additional
query
terms
that
are
statistically
likely
to
match
documents
on
the
intended
topic
.

However
,
query
expansion
techniques
rely
on
fixed
parameters
.

Our
investigation
of
the
effect
of
varying
these
parameters
shows
that
the
strategy
of
using
fixed
values
is
questionable
.


-DOCSTART-

In
multiple
-
source
information
systems
,
attribute
values
are
often
assessed
in
linguistic
terms
belonging
to
different
vocabularies
.

The
request
itself
,
which
may
include
preferences
,
may
be
expressed
using
terms
of
another
vocabulary
,
raising
the
problem
of
matching
the
query
and
the
information
in
a
semantic
manner
.

The
fuzzy
pattern
matching
framework
allows
us
to
compute
matching
degrees
between
queries
and
data
represented
by
fuzzy
sets
,
even
if
they
do
not
perfectly
match
.

The
qualitative
pattern
matching
no
longer
requires
a
fuzzy
set
representation
thanks
to
the
use
of
ontologies
for
computing
similarity
degrees
between
terms
.

This
allows
us
to
deal
with
information
querying
in
face
of
heterogeneous
sources
of
information
.

This
chapter
presents
this
tool
and
its
application
to
database
and
textual
information
retrieval
on

Post

war
telecommunications
network
is
completely
damaged
by
aerial
bombings
as
mostly
towers
and
elevated
structures
are
bombarded
.

This
brings
hindrances
to
the
postwar
information
retrieval
as
it
becomes
extremely
difficult
to
communicate
using
the
previously
established
communication
system
.

The
aim
of
this
paper
is
to
fabricate
a
MANET
based
emergency
communication
system
containing
Damage
Assessment
Subsystem
,
Data
Processing
Subsystem
and
a
Data
Localization
Subsystem
.

Apart
from
theoretically
formulating
the
Post

this
paper
focuses
on
collaborative
information

and
independent

The
goal
of
this
chapter
is
to
propose
a
methodology
and
tools
to
enhance
information
retrieval
and
navigation
on
the
Web
through
contextual
and
conceptual
help
.

This
methodology
provides
users
with
an
extended
navigation
space
by
adding
a
conceptual
and
a
semantic
layer
above
Web
data
.

The
conceptual
layer
is
made
of
Galois
lattices
which
cluster
Web
pages
into
concepts
according
to
their
common
features
(
in
particular
their
textual
content
These
lattices
represent
the
Global
Conceptual
Context
of
Web
pages
.

An
additional
navigation
layer
is
provided
by
ontologies
which
are
connected
to
the
conceptual
level
through
specific
concepts
of
the
lattices
.

Users
may
navigate
transparently
within
each
of
these
three
layers
and
go
from
one
to
another
very
easily
.

However
,
the
navigation
within
Galois
lattices
may
be
difficult
as
the
number
of
concepts
grows
very
fast
with
the
number
of
Web
pages
.

The
second
contribution
of
this
chapter
consists
in
providing
tools
to
help
users
navigate
within
a
complex
conceptual
lattice
.

A
new
similarity
measure
is
proposed
to
find
the
most
relevant
concept
to
start
a
navigation
or
to
choose
the
most
relevant
concept
to
visit
from
a
given
navigation
point
.

This
similarity
measure
is
based
on
Jiang
and
Conrath
’s
measure
used
for
ontology
matching
,
extended
to
reflect
conceptual
information
.

This
chapter
illustrates
these
methodology
and
tools
for
Web
information
retrieval
and
navigation
through
example
experimentations
and
presents
future
research
directions

This
special
issue
of
the
Journal
of
Medical

is
dedicated
to
the
coverage
of
the
Medical

at
the
17th
Hawaii
International
Conference
on
System
Sciences
,
which
was
held
in
Honolulu
,
Hawaii
,
in
January
1984
.

The
conference
is
an
annual
presentation
of
refereed
papers
,
panel
sessions
,
tutorials
,
task
forces
,
and
special
invited
presentations
in
the
information

The
program
is
intended
to
provide
a
forum
for
the
interchange
of
information
related
to
continuing
and
completed
research
in
applied
computer
science
.

The
Medical
Information

Track
again
continued
to
attract
a
number
of
excellent
papers
that
were
well
received
.

This
issue
contains
10
of
the
best
papers
that
were
presented
,
as
selected
by
the
session
chairpersons
at
the
conference
.

The
reader
is
referred
to
Volume

of
the
HICSS-17
Proceedings
for
the
complete
set
of
papers
.

The
increasing
importance
of
research
in
the
development
of
expert
systems
in
the
health
care
field
is
exemplified
by
the
fact
that
three
of
the
outstanding
papers
were
in
this
area
.

The
first
of
these
papers
relates
to
the
use
of
expert
systems
for
interpretive
reporting
in
the
field
of
pathology
.

The
second
paper
relating
to
the
use
of
expert
systems
describes
the
development
of
a
special
-
purpose
,
portable
system
to
be
used
by
practitioners
in
the
field
.

The
third
paper
selected
in
this
area
provides
a
comparison
of
the
MUMPS
and
LISP
programming
languages
for
the
implementation
of
such
systems
.

The
computerization
of
various
hospital
functions
was
also
of
wide
interest
at
the
conference
,
with
two
of
the
outstanding
papers
selected
from
this
group
.

The
first
of
these
papers
describes
the
implementation
of
a
computerized
nosocomial
infection
control
system
for
a
500-bed
tertiary

care
teaching
hospital
.

The
second
provides
a
framework
for
evaluating
the
impact
on
a
hospital
of
installing
computerized
information
systems
.

The
proliferation
of
the
application
of
microprocessor
-
based
systems
in
the
health
care
field
was
evidenced
by
a
number
of
papers
presented
at
the
conference
.

One
of
the
two
outstanding
papers
in
this
area
describes
the
development
of
an
interface
that
allows
deaf
-
blind
persons
to
interact
with
a
personal
computer
system

The
second
paper
presents
the
application
of
microprocessors
to
the
area
of
medical
measurement
.

Word
sense
disambiguation
(
WSD
)
is
an
intermediate
task
within
information
retrieval
and
information
extraction
,
which
attempts
selecting
the
proper
sense
of
ambiguous
terms
.

In
the
biomedical
domain
,
general
WSD
has
not
received
much
attention
compared
to
the
disambiguation
of
specific
categories
of
entities
like
proteins
and
genes
or
diseases
.

Statistical
learning
approaches
have
achieved
better
performance
compared
to
other
methods
.

On
the
other
hand
,
manually
annotated
data
is
limited
,
and
covering
all
the
ambiguous
cases
of
a
large
resource
like
the
UMLS
is
infeasible
.

Knowledge
-
based
approaches
using
the
UMLS
and
MEDLINE
citations
have
achieved
good
performance
but
below
that
of
statistical
learning
approaches
.

Our
best
knowledge
-
based
result
has
been
obtained
by
training
a
Na&#x0EF;ve
Bayes
algorithm
on
an
automatically
extracted
MEDLINE
corpus
.

In
this
work
,
we
extend
on
previous
methods
to
enhance
the
quality
of
an
automatically
extracted
corpus
using
related
terms
obtained
from
MEDLINE
without
manually
annotated
training
data
.

We
have
focused
on
the
extraction
of
collocations
which
might
be
used
in
combination
with
one
of
the
senses
of
the
ambiguous
terms
.

We
find
that
left
side
collocations
have
the
largest
improvement
in
accuracy
with
an
improvement
of
4&#x025

In
addition
,
the
combination
of
different
types
of
collocations
and
post

filtering
of
retrieved
citations
achieves
an
improvement
of
almost
9&#x025

a
solitary
activity

When
an
image
database
is
queried
with
a
particular
example
image
show
me
similar
images
the
corresponding
feature
vector
is
computed
and
the
most
similar
feature
vectors
from
the
database
are
searched
to
display
the
most
similar

in
the
database
.

This
paper
presents
the
design
and
implementation
of
a
high

application
to
facilitate
the

New
technologies
and
equipment
allow
for
mass
treatment
of
samples
and
research
teams
share
acquired
data
on
an
always
larger
scale
.

In
this
context
scientists
are
facing
a
major
data
exploitation
problem
.

More
precisely
,
using
these
data
sets
through
data
mining
tools
or
introducing
them
in
a
classical
experimental
approach
require
a
preliminary
understanding
of
the
information
space
,
in
order
to
direct
the
process
.

But
acquiring
this
grasp
on
the
data
is
a
complex
activity
,
which
is
seldom
supported
by
current
software
tools
.

The
goal
of
this
paper
is
to
introduce
a
solution
to
this
scientific
data
grasp
problem
.

Illustrated
in
the
Tissue
MicroArrays
application
domain
,
the
proposal
is
based
on
the
synthesis
notion
,
which
is
inspired
by
Information
Retrieval
paradigms
.

The
envisioned
synthesis
model
gives
a
central
role
to
the
study
the
researcher
wants
to
conduct
,
through
the
task
notion
.

It
allows
for
the
implementation
of
a
task
-
oriented
Information
Retrieval
prototype
system
.

Cases
studies
and
user
studies
were
used
to
validate
this
prototype
system
.

It
opens
interesting
prospects
for
the
extension
of
the
model
or
extensions
towards
other
application
domains

We
are
conducting
research
in
the
area
of
teleoperation
with
feedback
delay
.

Delay
occurs
with
earth
-
based
teleoperation
in
space
and
with
surface
-
based
teleoperation
with
untethered
submersibles
when
acoustic
communication
links
are
involved
.

the
delay
in
obtaining
position
and
force
feedback
from
remote
slave
arms
makes
teleoperation
extremely
difficult
.

We
are
proposing
a
novel
combination
of
graphics
and
manipulator
programming
to
solve
the
problem
by
interfacing
a
teleoperator
master
arm
to
a
graphics
based
simulator
of
the
remote
environment
coupled
with
a
robot
manipulator
at
the
remote
,
delayed
site
.

the
operator
's
actions
will
be
monitored
to
provide
both
kinesthetic
and
visual
feedback
and
to
generate
symbolic
motion
commands
to
the
remote
slave
.

the
slave
robot
will
then
execute
these
symbolic
commands
delayed
in
time
.

While
much
of
a
task
will
proceed
error
free
,
when
an
error
does
occur
the
slave
system
will
transmit
data
back
to
the
master
and
the
master
environment
will
be
"
reset
"
to
the
error
state
.

IR
(
Information
Retrieval
)
systems
search
for
important
documents
on
the
internet
by
measuring
the
importance
of
them
.

For
this
purpose
,
various
ranking
techniques
were
proposed
.

In
this
paper
,
we
propose
ReviewRank
and
ReviewRank
which
are
ranking
techniques
for
estimating
usefulness
of
book
reviews
based
on
the
tendency
of
users
.

With
an
increasing
number
of
people
buying
books
online
,
reviews
written
by
other
people
have
become
more
significant
.

General
ranking
techniques
measure
the
importance
of
documents
based
on
references
or
quotations
between
them
through
hyperlinks
.

However
,
the
techniques
are
not
suitable
for
ranking
book
reviews
since
they
were
developed
for
general
purposes
.

In
this
paper
,
we
analyze
the
characteristics
of
meaningful
book
reviews
based
on
voluntary
evaluation
of
people
and
propose
measures
for
considering
the
importance
.

We
also
suggest
an
algorithm
for
ranking
reviews
.

Experimental
results
show
that
our
approaches
outperform
both
previous
general
and
specific
(
searching
book
reviews
)
ranking
techniques
.

For
many
years
,
people
have
consumed
more
multimedia
content
than
written
information
.

Yet
the
tools
consumers
use
to
find
the
content
they
want
to
see
are
often
based
on
text
.

Hence
,
despite
years
of
vibrant
research
,
the
multimedia
field
has
been
criticized
for
a
lack
of
real
-
world
applications
.

A
recent
panel
discussion
on
multimedia
search
had
the
revealing
title
:
Multimedia
Information
Retrieval
:

What
Is
It
,
and
Why
Is
n’t
Anyone
Using
It
?

With
the
exception
of
face
recognition
and
optical
character
recognition
,
little
of
the
wonderful
technology
created
by
the
multimedia
community
has
met
with
commercial
success
.

Search
engines
look
for
multimedia
content
on
the
basis
of
the
text
around
the
object
.

Recommendation
engines
do
better
by
ignoring
the
content
completely
and
correlating
user
’s
rating
data
instead
.

The
ACM
Multimedia
Grand
Challenge
was
designed
to
bring
such
commercial
needs
to
the
attention
of
researchers
.

Seven
industrial
partners
led
the
Multimedia
Grand
Challenge
by
identifying
issues
they
think
are
important
to
their
business
and
worth
further
study

Different
term
weighting
techniques
such
as
TF\cdot
IDF
or
BM25
have
been
used
intensely
for
manifold
text
-
based
information
retrieval
tasks
.

Their
use
for
modeling
term
profiles
for
named
entities
and
subsequent
calculation
of
similarities
between
these
named
entities
have
been
studied
to
a
much
smaller
extent
.

The
recent
trend
of
microblogging
made
available
massive
amounts
of
information
about
almost
every
topic
around
the
world
.

Therefore
,
microblogs
represent
a
valuable
source
for
text
-
based
named
entity
modeling
.

In
this
paper
,
we
present
a
systematic
and
comprehensive
evaluation
of
different
term
weighting
measures
,
normalization
techniques
,
query
schemes
,
index
term
sets
,
and
similarity
functions
for
the
task
of
inferring
similarities
between
named
entities
,
based
on
data
extracted
from
microblog
posts
.

We
analyze
several
thousand
combinations
of
choices
for
the
above
mentioned
dimensions
,
which
influence
the
similarity
calculation
process
,
and
we
investigate
in
which
way
they
impact
the
quality
of
the
similarity
estimates
.

Evaluation
is
performed
using
three
real
-
world
data
sets
:
two
collections
of
microblogs
related
to
music
artists
and
one
related
to
movies
.

For
the
music
collections
,
we
present
results
of
genre
classification
experiments
using
as
benchmark
genre
information
from
allmusic.com

For
the
movie
collection
,
we
present
results
of
multi
-
class
classification
experiments
using
as
benchmark
categories
from
IMDb

We
show
that
microblogs
can
indeed
be
exploited
to
model
named
entity
similarity
with
remarkable
accuracy
,
provided
the
correct
settings
for
the
analyzed
aspects
are
used
.

We
further
compare
the
results
to
those
obtained
when
using
Web

as

In
this
paper
,
we
explore
several
statistical
methods
to
find
solutions
to
the
problem
of
query
translation
ambiguity
.

Indeed
,
we
propose
and
compare
a
new
possibilistic
approach
for
query
translation
derived
from
a
probabilistic
one
,
by
applying
a
classical
probability
-
possibility
transformation
of
probability
distributions
,
which
introduces
a
certain
tolerance
in
the
selection
of
word
translations
.

Finally
,
the
best
words
are
selected
based
on
a
similarity
measure
.

The
experiments
are
performed
on

us
to

the
effectiveness

A
two
server
private
information
retrieval
(
PIR
)
scheme
allows
a
user
U
to
retrieve
the
i
-
th
bit
of
an
n
-
bit
string
x
replicated
between
two
servers
while
each
server
individually
learns
no
information
about
i.

The
main
parameter
of
interest
in
a
PIR
scheme
is
its
communication
complexity
,
namely
the
number
of
bits
exchanged
by
the
user
and
the
servers
.

A
large
amount
of
effort
has
been
invested
by
researchers
over
the
last
decade
in
search
for
efficient
PIR
schemes
.

A
number
of
different
schemes
[
6
,
4
,
19
]
have
been
proposed
,
however
all
of
them
ended
up
with
the
same
communication
complexity
of
O(n1/3

The
best
known
lower

to

by

The
tremendous
gap
between
upper
and
lower
bounds

is
the
focus
of
our
paper
.

We
show
an
Ω(n1/3
)
lower
bound
in
a
restricted
model
that
nevertheless
captures
all
known
upper
bound
techniques
.

Our
lower
bound
applies
to
bilinear
group
based
PIR
schemes
.

A
bilinear
PIR
scheme
is
a
one
round
PIR
scheme
,
where
user
computes
the
dot
product
of
servers’
responses
to
obtain
the
desired
value
of
the
i
-
th
bit
.

Every
linear
scheme
can
be
turned
into
a
bilinear
one
.

A
group
based
PIR
scheme
,
is
a
PIR
scheme
,
that
involves
servers
representing
database
by
a
function
on
a
certain
finite
group
G
,
and
allows
user
to
retrieve
the
value
of
this
function
at
any
group
element
using
the
natural
secret
sharing
scheme
based
on
G.

Our
proof
relies
on
some
basic
notions
of
representation
theory
of
finite
groups
.

We
also
discuss
the
approaches
one
may
take
to
obtain
a
general
lower
bound
for
bilinear
PIR
.

The
statistical
machine
translation
(
SMT
)
component
of
cross
-
lingual
information
retrieval
(
CLIR
)
systems
is
often
regarded
as
black
box
that
is
optimized
for
translation
quality
independent
from
the
retrieval
task
.

In
recent
work
[
10
SMT
has
been
tuned
for
retrieval
by
training
a
reranker
on
$
k$-best
translations
ordered
according
to
their
retrieval
performance
.

In
this
paper
we
propose
a
decomposable
proxy
for
retrieval
quality
that
obviates
the
need
for
costly
intermediate
retrieval
.

Furthermore
,
we
explore
the
full
search
space
of
the
SMT
decoder
by
directly
optimizing
decoder
parameters
under
a
retrieval
-
based
objective
.

Experimental
results
for
patent
retrieval
show
our
approach
to
be
a
promising
alternative
to
the
standard

In
this
paper
,
we
describe
a
new
way
of
representing
a
symbolic
picture
by
a
two
-
dimensional
string
.

A
picture
query
can
also
be
specified
as
a
2-D
string
.

The
problem
of
pictorial
information
retrieval
then
becomes
a
problem
of
2-D
subsequence
matching
.

We
present
algorithms
for
encoding
a
symbolic
picture
into
its
2-D
string
representation
,
reconstructing
a
picture
from
its
2-D
string
representation
,
and
matching
a
2-D
string
with
another
2-D
string
.

We
also
prove
the
necessary
and
sufficient
conditions
to
characterize
ambiguous
pictures
for
reduced
2-D
strings
as
well
as
normal
2-D
strings
.

This
approach
thus
allows
an
efficient
and
natural
way
to
construct
iconic
indexes
for

in
the
context
of
journal

Respondents
to
our

are
mostly
active
in
the
information

,
including

Besides
WTW
,
other
attributes
included
in

are
the

the

,
the

,
the
ISI

,
and
the
standing
of
the

Interaction

originating
from
scientists’
personal
characteristics
(
age

,
motivations
to

with
the
WTW
are
highlighted
.

A
difference
was
made
between
submitting
a
high
quality
article
and
a
standard
article
.

Among
the
interesting
results
obtained
from
our
analysis
we
mention
that
for
a
high
-
quality
article
,
researchers
are
willing
to
wait
some
18
months
longer
for
a
journal
with
an
ISI
impact
factor
above
2
than
for
a
journal
without
an
impact
factor
,
keeping
all
other
factors
constant
.

For
a
standard
article
,
the
WTW
decreases
to
some
8
months
.

Gender

The
use
of
Knowledge
Organization
Systems
(
KOSs
)
in
aggregated
metadata
collections
facilitates
the
implementation
of
search
mechanisms
operating
on
the

term
or
keyphrase
space
,
thus
preparing
the
ground
for
improved
browsing
,
more
accurate
retrieval
and
better
user
profiling
.

Automatic
thesaurus
-
based
keyphrase
extraction
appears
to
be
an
inexpensive
tool
to
obtain
this
information
,
but
the
studies
on
its
effectiveness
are
scattered
and
do
not
consider
the
practical
applicability
of
these
techniques
compared
to
the
quality
obtained
by
involving
human
experts
.

This
paper
presents
an
evaluation
of
keyphrase
extraction
using
the
KEA
software
and
the
AGROVOC
vocabulary
on
a
sample
of
a
large
collection
of
metadata
in
the
field
of
agriculture
from
the
AGRIS
database
.

This
effort
includes
a
double
evaluation
,
the
classical
automatic
evaluation
based
on
precision
and
recall
measures
,
plus
a
blind
evaluation
aimed
to
contrast
the
quality
of
the
keyphrases
extracted
against
expert
-
provided
samples
and
against
the
keyphrases
originally
recorded
in
the
metadata
.

Results
show
not
only
that
KEA
outperforms
humans
in
matching
the
original
keyphrases
,
but
also
that
the
quality
of
the
keyphrases
extracted
was
similar
to
those
provided
by
humans

presented
below
data
was
extracted
from
20
free
websites
to
explore
the
categories
used

,
and
the
organizational

This
project
contributes
to
an
area
of
research
that
remains
relatively
unexplored
,
and
provides
useful
insights
into
the
organization
and

surrounding
what
is
inarguably
one
of
the

Abstract
:
Studies

tagging
vocabularies
(
e.g
Yoon

)
suggest
that
tag
agreement
across
users
is
due
to
wide
-
spread
use
of
basic
level
category
terms
.

This
study
investigated
whether
differences
in
the
superordinate
,
subordinate
or
basic
level
of
abstraction
were
influenced
by
resource
content
.

Analysis
of
7617
tags
assigned
by
40
participants
to
36
online
resources
representing
four
content
categories
(
i.e

CLOTHING
,

)
found
significant
differences
in
the
frequency
of

in
the
FRUIT
content
category
and
of
superordinate

that

in
the

of

is
natural
in

As
an
academic
specialty
in
the
French
higher
education
,
Information
Science
was
shaped
by
short
-
term
government
policies
implemented
after
world
war
II
until
the
late
nineties
.

The
field
was
officially
recognised
in
1974
as
part
of
when
an
interdisciplinary
field
named
“
Information
and
Communication
Science
Information
Science
was
seen
by
the
successive
French
governments
as
an
instrument
with
which
to
gain
information
independence
from
the
United
States
.

The
aim
of
was
to
develop
information
infrastructures
(
telecommunications
,
databases
,
servers
hence
to
develop
an
industry
rather
than
a
science
.

This
led
to
narrowing
the
focus
of
the
field
to
only
one
type
of
information
scientific
and
technical
information
.

The
first
higher
education
curricula
and
doctoral
programs
were
technologically
-
oriented
,
driven
by
the
need
to
train
information
professionals
rather
than
scientists
.

Little
attention
was
paid
to
research
on
conceptual
models
,
on
theories
and
on
knowledge
organisation
which
used
to
be
the
stronghold
of
European
and
French
pioneers
in
bibliography
and
in
documentation
(
Paul
Otlet
,
Suzanne
Briet
,
Georgette
and
Eric
de
Grolier
among
others
Currently
,
the
trend
is
to
bring
information
science
back
to
its
humanistic
origins
and
to
engage
in
a
more
theoretical
and
people
-
oriented
research
.

However
,
there
is
yet
no
coherent
agenda
that
clearly
defines
what
information
science
research
should
be
about
.

There
is
also
little
visibility
of
French
information
science
both
at
the
national
and
international
arena

Emails
,
SMS
,
Chat
transcripts
and
Social
Network
Messages
play
a
vital
role
in
present
day‟s
communication
.

These
digitally
communicated
data
sets
are
different
from
well
typed
English
documents
like
books
,
news
papers
Etc
in
2
ways
.

One
is
the
use
of
acronyms
instead
of
typing
full
form
of
the
term
and
another
one
is
the
existence
of
misspelled
words
.

Because
of
these
reasons
,
information
retrieval
methods
used
for
analyzing
well
typed
English
documents
may
not
be
well
suitable
to
analyze
them
.

In
this
paper
we
propose
an
information
retrieval
method
to
address
the
high
recall
requirements
of
retrieving
information
from
digitally
communicated

Research
in
Information
Retrieval
has
traditionally
focused
on
serving
the
best
results
for
a
single
query
.

Real
users
,
however
,
often
begin
an
interaction
with
a
search
engine
with
a
sufficiently
under
-
specified
information
need
that
they
will
need
to
reformulate
before
they
find
either
the
one
thing
or
every
thing
they
are
looking
for
.

We
define
a
session
as
the
sequence
of
queries
and
interactions
that
a
user
performs
in
service
of
an
information
need
.

The
first
workshop
on
Information
Retrieval

Over
Query
Sessions
was
held
at
ECIR
2011
in
Dublin
,
Ireland
,
with
the
purpose
of
investigating
questions
of
measuring
,
analyzing
,
and
optimizing
IR
system
behavior
over
a
session
of
reformulations

Internet
can
be
misused
by
cyber
criminals
as
a
platform
to
conduct
illegitimate
activities
(
such
as
harassment
,
cyber
bullying
,
and
incitement
of
hate
or
violence
)
anonymously
.

As
a
result
,
authorship
analysis
of
anonymous
texts
in
Internet
(
such
as
emails
,
forum
comments
)
has
attracted
significant
attention
in
the
digital
forensic
and
text
mining
communities
.

The
main
problem
is
a
large
number
of
possible
of
authors
,
which
hinders
the
effective
identification
of
a
true
author
.

We
interpret
open
class
author
attribution
as
a
process
of
expert
recommendation
where
the
decision
support
system
returns
a
list
of
suspected
authors
for
further
analysis
by
forensics
experts
rather
than
a
single
prediction
result
,
thus
reducing
the
scale
of
the
problem
.

We
describe
the
task
formally
and
present
algorithms
for
constructing
the
suspected
author
list
.

For
evaluation
we
propose
using
a
simple
Winner
-
Takes
-
All
(
WTA
)
metric
as
well
as
a
set
of
gain
-
discount
model
based
metrics
from
the
information
retrieval
domain
(
mean
reciprocal
rank
,
discounted
cumulative
gain
and
rank
-
biased
precision
We
also
propose
the
List
Precision
(
LP
)
metric
as
an
extension
of
WTA
for
evaluating
the
usability
of
the
suspected
author
list
.

For
experiments
,
we
use
our
own
dataset
of
Internet
comments
in
Lithuanian
language
and
consider
the
use
of
language
-
specific
(
Lithuanian
)
lexical
features
together
with
general
lexical
features
derived
from
English
language
.

For
classification
we
use
one
-
class
Support
Vector
Machine
(
SVM
)
classifier
.

The
results
of
experiments
show
that
the
usability
of
open
class
author
attribution
can
be
improved
considerably
by
using
a
set
of
language
-
specific
lexical
features
together
with
general
lexical
features
,
while
the
proposed
method
can
be
used
to
reduce
the
number
of
suspected
authors
thus
alleviating
the
work
of
forensic
linguists

Three
measures
of
effectiveness
of
an
information
retrieval
system
are
formulated
in
terms
of
a
user
's
estimate
of
the
relevance
of
items
output
.

In
each
instance
the
type
of
question
logic
allowed
is
postulated
without
specification
of
certain
parameters
which
denote
the
weights
attached
to
the
question
terms
.

The
parameters
are
then
determined
to
maximise
the
effectiveness
.

Their
values
depend
on
certain
statistics
of
the
data
base
.

The
search
effectiveness
is
then
optimum
for
the
permitted
form
of
question
,
the
measure
of
output
relevance
,
and
for
data
bases
of
similar
statistics
.

The
techniques
used
are
analogous
to
those
used
to
define
a
matched

a

Shared
evaluation
tasks
have
become
popular
over
the
last
decades
as
ways
of
making
communities
of
researchers
advance
together
.

This
paper
presents
the
organization
of
five
new
shared
task
evaluation
campaigns
for
image
indexing
and
retrieval
.

We
have
designed
these
campaigns
based
on
our
previous
experience
of
participating
in
or
organizing
various
text
retrieval
campaigns
such
as
TREC
,
AMARYLLIS
and
CLEF
.

Our
purpose
behind
these
campaigns
is
to
minimize
the
gap
between
technology
evaluation
and
user
-
oriented
evaluation
in
the
field
of
information

We
study
information
retrieval
(
IR
)
on
Turkish
texts
using
a
large
-
scale
test
collection
that
contains
408,305
documents
and
72
ad
hoc
queries
.

We
examine
the
effects
of
several
stemming
options
and
query
-
document
matching
functions
on
retrieval
performance
.

We
show
that
a
simple
word
truncation
approach
,
a
word
truncation
approach
that
uses
language
dependent
corpus
statistics
,
and
an
elaborate
lemmatizer
-
based
stemmer
provide
similar
retrieval
effectiveness
in
Turkish
IR
.

We
investigate
the
effects
of
a
range
of
search
conditions
on
the
retrieval
performance
;
these
include
the
scalability
issues
,
query
and
document
length
effects
,
and
the

of

It
is
common
to
model
structured
document
databases
by
context
-
free
and
extended
context
-
free
grammars
.

A
crucial
difference
is
that
the
derivation
trees
of
the
former
are
ranked
,
while
those
of
the
latter
are
not
.

A
main
task
in
document
transformation
and
information
retrieval
is
locating
subtrees
satisfying
some
pattern
.

Therefore
,
unary
queries
,
i.e
queries
that
map
a
tree
to
a
set
of
its
nodes
,
play
an
important
role
in
the
context
of
structured
document
databases
.

We
want
to
understand
how
the
natural
and
well
-
studied
computation
model
of
tree
automata
can
be
used
to
express
such
queries
.

We
define
a
query
automaton
(
QA
)
as
a
deterministic
two
-
way
finite
automaton
over
trees
that
has
the
ability
to
select
nodes
depending
on
the
state
and
the
label
at
those
nodes
.

We
study
QAs
over
ranked
as
well
as
over
unranked
trees
.

More
precisely
,
we
characterize
the
expressiveness
of
the
different
formalisms
by
linking
them
to
monadic
second
-
order
logic
,
and
we
establish
the
complexity
of
their
non
-
emptiness
and
equivalence
problem

This
proposal
is
concerned
with
three
-
dimensional
object
recognition
from
range
data
using
superquadric
primitives
.

Superquadrics
are
a
family
of
parametric
shape
models
which
represent
objects
at
the
part
level
and
can
account
for
a
wide
variety
of
natural
and
man
-
made
forms
.

An
integrated
framework
for
segmenting
dense
range
data
of
complex
3-D
objects
into
their
constituent
parts
in
terms
of
bi
-
quadric
surface
patches
and
superquadric
shape
primitives
is
described
in
[
29
We
propose
a
vision
architecture
that
scales
well
as
the
size
of
its
model
database
grows
.

Following
the
recovery
of
superquadric
primitives
from
the
input
depth
map
,
we
split
the
computation
into
two
concurrent
processing
streams
.

One
is
concerned
with
the
classification
of
individual
parts
using
viewpoint
-
invariant
shape
information
while
the
other
classifies
pairwise
part
relationships
using
their
relative
size
,
orientation
and
type
of
joint
.

The
major
contribution
of
this
proposal
lies
in
a
principled
solution
to
the
very
difficult
problems
of
superquadric
part
classification
and
model
indexing
.

The
problem
is
how
to
retrieve
the
best
matched
models
without
exploring
all
possible
object
matches
.

Our
approach
is
to
cluster
together
similar
model
parts
to
create
a
reasonable
number
of
prototypical
part
classes
(
protoparts
Each
superquadric
part
recovered
from
the
input
is
paired
with
the
best
matching
protopart
using
precomputed
class
statistics
.

A
parallel
,
theoretically
-
well
grounded
evidential
recognition
algorithm
quickly
selects
models
consistent
with
the
classified
parts
.

Classified
part
relations
(
protorelations
)
are
used
to
further
reduce
the
number
of
consistent
models
and
remaining
ambiguities
are
resolved
using
sequential
topdown
search
.

with
some
scientists
providing
good
descriptions
of
vegetation

and
other
relevant
conditions
,
whereas
others
provided
little

no

Beginning
in
the
19th
century
,
the
most
significant
change
was
the
elimination
of
the
amateur

Instead
,
predominant
practice
throughout
the
20th
century
has
been
for
professional
scientists
to
serve
both
as
field
collectors
and
museum
experts
.

Museums
worldwide
now
hold
an
estimated
two
to
three
billion
biodiversity
specimens

about
75
%
in
the
industrialized
countries
,
and
the
number
continues
to
grow
(

There
are
standard
practices
for
treating
and
preserving
new
specimens
.

Plants
generally
are
flattened
,
dried
and
glued
to
reinforcing

Vertebrate
animals
may
be
preserved
whole
in
alcohol
or
represented
only
by
their
skins
,
bones
or
shells
.

Invertebrates
like
insects
are
pinned
,
preserved
in
alcohol
or
mounted
on
microscope
slides
.

In
all
cases
specimens
are
accompanied
by
a
label

biodiversity
and

roscience
are
becoming
increasingly
technological
and
data

At
the
same
time
biodiversity
studies
retain
many
traditional
tools
and
materials
,
while
in
neuroscience
new
tools
are
frequently
developed
.

Information
science
can
help
both
fields
develop
tools
that
exploit
modern

to
increase

gathering
efficiency
,
to
improve
quality
control
and
,
where
necessary

to
integrate

and
modern

We
will

by
summarizing
how

One
of
the
core
components
in
information
retrieval(IR
)
is
the
document
-
term
-
weighting
scheme
.

In
this
paper
,
we
will
propose
a
novel
learning
-
based
term
-
weighting
approach
to
improve
the
retrieval
performance
of
vector
space
model
in
homogeneous
collections
.

We
first
introduce
a
simple
learning
system
to
weighting
the
index
terms
of
documents
.

Then
,
we
deduce
a
formal
computational
approach
according
to
some
theories
of
matrix
computation
and
statistical
inference
.

Our
experiments
on
8
collections
will
show
that
our
approach
outperforms
classic
tfidf
weighting
,
about
20%∼45
%
.

We
observe
through
simulations
that
an
information
sharing
scheme
using
variable
identifiers
in
mobile
ad
-
hoc
networks
,
which
we
previously
proposed
,
enables
us
to
heuristically
find
desired
information
by
having
identifiers
varied
.

In
the
information
sharing
,
people
create
identifiers
that
represent
their
interest
,
and
information
published
by
the
people
are
probabilistically
propagated
using
distances
between
identifiers
of
the
people
.

The
identifiers
of
the
people
dynamically
change
depending
on
people
surrounding
each
person
.

Under
a
situation
that
an
identifier
is
variable
,
we
set
how
many
times
people
obtained
desired
information
to
be
an
observation
item
.

Also
,
we
consider
a
process
that
people
heuristically
find
desired
information
into
a
simulation
model
and
set
how
many
times
people
obtain
such
information
to
be
an
observation
item
.

In
simulations
,
we
show
examples
of
observation
for
these
items

Maintenance
manuals
include
general
methods
and
procedures
for
industrial
maintenance
and
they
contain
information
about
principles
of
maintenance
methods
.

Particularly
,
Non
-

Destructive
Testing
(
NDT
)
methods
are
important
for
the
detection
of
aeronautical
defects
and
they
can
be
used
for
various
kinds
of
material
and
in
different
environments
.

Conventional
non
-
destructive
evaluation
inspections
are
done
at
periodic
maintenance
checks
.

Usually
,
the
list
of
tools
used
in
a
maintenance
program
is
simply
located
in
the
introduction
of
manuals
,
without
any
precision
as
regards
to
their
characteristics
,
except
for
a
short
description
of
the
manufacturer
and
tasks
in
which
they
are
employed
.

Improving
the
identification
concepts
of
the
maintenance
tools
is
needed
to
manage
the
set
of
equipments
and
establish
a
system
of
equivalence
:
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
consistent
maintenance
conceptualization
,
flexible
enough
to
fit
all
current
equipment
,
but
also
all
those
likely
to
be
added
/
used
in
the
future
.

Our
contribution
is
related
to
the
formal
specification
of
the
system
of
functional
equivalences
that
can
facilitate
the
maintenance
activities
with
means
to
determine
whether
a
tool
can
be
substituted
for
another
by
observing
their
key
parameters
in
the
identified
characteristics
.

Reasoning
mechanisms
of
conceptual
graphs
constitute
the
baseline
elements
to
measure
the
fit
or
unfit
between
an
equipment
model
and
a
maintenance
activity
model
.

Graph
operations
are
used
for
processing
answers
to
a
query
and
this
graph
-
based
approach
to
the
search
method
is
in
-
line
with
the
logical
view
of
information
retrieval
.

The
methodology
described
supports
knowledge
formalization
and
capitalization
of
experienced
NDT
practitioners
.

As
a
result
,
it
enables
the
selection
of
a
NDT
technique
and
outlines
its
capabilities
with
acceptable

The
Multimedia
Information

in

has
been
widely
studied

In
this

,
we
propose
a
new
comprehensive
similarity
function
to
calculate
the
similarity
of
peers
in
the
P2P
networks
so
as
to
classify
these
peers
.

We
also
apply
the
relevance
feedback
in
the
process
of
retrieval
in
order
to
improve
the
speed
and
accuracy
of
retrieval
.

In
simulation
,
we
compare
our
algorithm
to
the
traditional
method
on
the
basis
of
the
performance
of
the
test
which
includes
four
types
of
thousands

Introduction
to
Information
Retrieval
by
Manning
,
Prabhakar
and
Schütze
is
the
authors’
latest
book
on
Information
Retrieval

(
IR
While
it
is
primarily
meant
to
be
used
as
a
textbook
for
relevant
university
courses
,
this
book
combines
a
near
-
complete
view
of
the
theoretical
foundations
of
IR
alongside
a
consistent
and
well
-
presented
treatment
of
many
issues
that
arise
on
a
practical
,
implementation
-
centric
level
.

This
approach
makes
this
book
a
useful
resource
not
only
to
senior
university
students
but
also
to
IR
researchers
and
keen
software
engineers
and
computer
scientists
alike
.

After
the
successful
book
,
Foundations
of
Statistical
Natural
Language
Processing
by
Manning
and
Schütze
,
it
is
of
no
surprise
that
the
authors
have
also
included
an
extensive
(
as
far
as
IR
books
go
)
introduction
to
the
neighboring
research
fields
of
Machine
Learning
and
Numerical
Methods
.

Another
worth
-
noting
fact
,
which
separates
this
book
from
other
textbooks
in
the
field
,
is
that
this
has
been
made
fully
available
on
the
Web
,
encouraging
students
and
professionals
to
communicate
their
comments
and
ideas
to
the
authors
,
thus
making
it
an
increasingly
accurate
and
useful
resource
.

The
book
’s
companion
website
can
be
found
at
http
wwwcsli.stanford.edu/*hinrich/information-retrieval-book.htm
.

The
book
starts
off
with
a
solid
introduction
to
the
field
through
the
presentation
of
the
Boolean
retrieval
model
.

The
introduction
of
information
retrieval
concepts
,
such
as
information
need
,
relevance
,
precision
and
recall
are
given
through
applied
examples
of
Boolean
retrieval
.

Using
the
Boolean
model
alongside
real
-
life
examples
is
both
educationally
useful
as
well
as
it
is
engaging
for
the
reader
.

A
first
look
at
the
inverted
index
is
given
early
in
the
book
,
placing
the
content
well
into
a
perspective
of
data
structures
and
algorithms
.

Building
on
this
trend
and
given
the
introduction
of
the
rather
straightforward
Boolean
model
the
authors
choose
to
dedicate
the
first
eight
chapters
of
the
book
to
algorithmic
and
implementation
issues
.

To
the
reviewer
’s
understanding
this
approach
is
particularly
beneficial
for
educational
purposes
as
it
is
not
uncommon
for
students
to
fail
to
see
the
connection
between
the
theory
behind
IR
and
its
corresponding
engineering
aspect

Query
by
Singing

Humming
(
QBSH

a
most
natural

music
recognition

A

Many
Music

have
been
used
to
carry
out
the

In

Expressive
indexing
languages
are
called
for
to
obtain
faithful
representations
of
multimedia
documents
.

They
become
a
decisive
factor
to
alleviate
the
noise
problem
,
which
is
now
often
encountered
with
commercial
search
engines
.

In
this
case
,
noise
consists
in
a
great
number
of
non
-
relevant
answers
to
user
’s
queries
,
which
compromises
interrogation
efficiency
.

The
use
of
complex
formalisms
to
handle
the
problem
is
not
straight
-
forward
,
as
one
of
their
general
characteristics
is
to
have
high
,
sometimes
unacceptable
computational
costs
.

The
RELIEF
image
retrieval
system
[
OP98
]
is
the
result
of
research
conducted
for
several
years
at
the
IMAG
research
institute
of
the
University
of
Grenoble
.

It
is
proposed
as
a
solution
to
the
challenge
of
using
powerful
indexing
languages
to
reduce
noise
and
conversely
increase
precision
,
while
limiting
execution
times
to
acceptable
values
.

RELIEF
takes
benefit
from
the
richness
of
the
conceptual
graphs
formalism
[
Sow841
and
the
speed
provided
by
classical
information
retrieval
(
IR
)
techniques
.

The
system
is
an
operational
implementation
of
a
logical
IR
model
applied
to
the
conceptual
graphs
formalism
.

A
sound
algebraic
approach
is
proposed
that
permits
to
organize
the
indexes
,
which
am
conceptual
graphs
,
into
an
inverted
file
-
based
structure
that
is
then
used
for
faster
retrieval
[

The
system
is
integrated
on
top
of
the

object

DBMS
,
which
provides
a
complete
programming
environment
,
including
the
fourth
generation
language
OsC
,
the
OQL
query
language
that
conforms
to
the
ODMG
standard
,
and
the
OzLook
graphical
interface
tool
.

The
architecture
of
our
system
is
shown
in
figure

.

It
supports
image
handling
,
by
an
image
manager
that
makes
use
of
basic
0s

The
ROGER
platform
[
Oun98
]
handles
conceptual
graphs
;
it
is
programmed
in
OsC
and
an
02Look
interface
allows
for
off
-
line
insertion
,
change
,
consistency
tests
and
visualization
of
the
indexes
.

Retrieval
can
be
performed
from
a
Web
browser
,
through
our
interrogation
interface
,
which
uses
the
OsWeb
tool
to
access
the
database
.

To
achieve
portability
and
to
manage
the
presentation
,
an
additional
JAVA
-
based
layer
is
provided
.

The
availability
of
recent
advances
in
the
object

domain
and
the
support
of
database
connections
via
Web
browsers
are
the
main
reasons
for
the
choice
of

to
the
integration
of

Probabilistic
networks
are
now
fairly
well
established
as
practical
representations
of
knowledge
for
reasoning
under
uncertainty
,
as
demonstrated
by
an
increasing
number
of
successful
applications
in
such
domains
as
(
medical
)
diagnosis
and
prognosis
,
planning
,
vision
,
information
retrieval
,
and
natural
language
processing
.

A
probabilistic
network
(
also
referred
to
as
a
belief
network
,
Bayesian
network
,
or
,
somewhat
imprecisely
,
causal
network
)
consists
of
a
graphical
structure
,
encoding
a
domain
’s
variables
and
the
qualitative
relationships
between
them
,
and
a
quantitative
part
,
encoding
probabilities
over
the
variables
[
29
Building
a
probabilistic
network
for
a
domain
of
application
involves
three
tasks
.

The
first
of
these
is
to
identify
the
variables
that
are
of
importance
,
along
with
their
possible
values
.

Once
the
important
domain
variables
have
been
identified
,
the
second
task
is
to
identify
the
relationships
between
the
variables
discerned
and
to
express
these
in
a
graphical
structure
.

The
tasks
of
eliciting
the
variables
and
values
of
importance
as
well
as
the
relationships
between
them
from
domain
experts
is
comparable
,
to
at
least
some
extent
,
to
knowledge
engineering
for
other
artificial
-
intelligence
representations
and
,
although
it
may
require
significant
effort
,
is
generally
considered
doable
.

The
last
task
in
building
a
probabilistic
network
is
to
obtain
the
probabilities
that
are
required
for
its
quantitative
part
.

This
task
often
appears
more
daunting
Where
do
the
numbers
come
from
is
a
commonly
asked
question
.

The
three
tasks
in
building
a
probabilistic
network
are
,
in
principle
,
performed
one
after
the
other
.

Building
a
network
,
however
,
often
requires
a
careful
trade
-
off
between
the
desire
for
a
large
and
rich
model
to
obtain
accurate
results
on
the
one
hand
,
and
the
costs
of
construction
and
maintenance
and
the
complexity
of
probabilistic
inference
on
the
other
hand
.

In
practice
,
therefore
,
building
a
probabilistic
network
is
a
process
that
iterates
over
these
tasks
until
a
network
results
that
is
deemed
requisite
.

In
collaboration
with
Finn
V.
Jensen
and
Max
Henrion
,
we
organised
in
1995
a
workshop
devoted
to
the
theme
of
obtaining
the
numbers
,
the
most
daunting
task
in
building
probabilistic
networks
[

The
workshop
was
held
in
conjunction
with
the
Fourteenth
International
Joint
Conference
on
Artificial
Intelligence
(
IJCAI’95
)
and
had
a
programme
of
presentations
of
selected
contributions
and
ample
slots
for
flash
communications
and
discussion
.

Scientists
from
such
disciplines
as
decision
analysis
,
statistics
,
and
computer
science
attended
the
workshop
.

The
interest
in
the
workshop
,
both
during
IJCAI’95
and
afterwards
,
prompted
us
to
follow
up
on
the
theme

User

The

of

characterize
the

While
standard

perform

rely

the

problem

generalizing
it
in
terms
of
performance
prediction
techniques
,
whose
goal
is
to
predict
the
performance
of
an

system
in
response
to
a

We
investigate
how
to

the

to
define
a
unified
framework
where
we
conduct
an
objective
analysis
of
the
effectiveness
(

of

enables
discriminating

are
caused
by
the
used

by
the
ways

Our
original
paper
(
Grosz
,
Joshi
,
and
Weinstein
,
1983
)
on
centering
claimed
that
certain
entities
mentioned
in
an
utterance
were
more
central
than
others
and
that
this
property
imposed
constraints
on
a
speaker
's
use
of
different
types
of
referring
expression
.

Centering
was
proposed
as
a
model
that
accounted
for
this
phenomenon
.

We
argued
that
the
compatibility
of
centering
properties
of
an
utterance
with
choice
of
referring
expression
affected
the
coherence
of
discourse
.

Subsequently
,
we
expanded
the
ideas
presented
therein
.

We
defined
various
centering
constructs
and
proposed
two
centering
rules
in
terms
of
these
constructs
.

A
draft
manuscript
describing
this
elaborated
centering
framework
and
presenting
some
initial
theoretical
claims
has
been
in
wide
circulation
since
1986
.

This
draft
(
Grosz
,
Joshi
,
and
Weinstein
1986
,
hereafter
,
GJW86
)
has
led
to
a
number
of
papers
by
others
on
this
topic
and
has
been
extensively
cited
,
but
has
never
been
published
.

We
have
been
urged
to
publish
the
more
detailed
description
of
the
centering
framework
and
theory
proposed
in
GJW86
so
that
an
official
version
would
be
archivally
available
.

The
task
of
completing
and
revising
this
draft
became
more
daunting
as
time
passed
and
more
and
more
papers
appeared
on
centering
.

Many
of
these
papers
proposed
extensions
to
or
revisions
of
the
theory
and
attempted
to
answer
questions
posed
in
GJW86
.

It
has
become
ever
more
clear
that
it
would
be
useful
to
have
a
"
definitive
"
statement
of
the
original
motivations
for
centering
,
the
basic
definitions
underlying
the
centering
framework
,
and
the
original
theoretical
claims
.

This
paper
attempts
to
meet
that
need
.

To
accomplish
this
goal
,
we
have
chosen
to
remove
descriptions
of
many
open
research
questions
posed
in
GJW86
as
well
as
solutions
that
were
only
partially
developed
.

We
have
also
greatly
shortened
the
discussion
of
criteria
for
and
constraints
on
a
possible
semantic
theory
as
a
foundation
for
this
work
.

The
efficiency
of
information
retrieval
(
IR
)
algorithms
has
always
been
of
interest
to
researchers
at
the
computer
science
end
of
the
IR
field
,
and
index
compression
techniques
,
intersection
and
ranking
algorithms
,
and
pruning
mechanisms
have
been
a
constant
feature
of
IR
conferences
and
journals
over
many
years
.

Efficiency
is
also
of
serious
economic
concern
to
operators
of
commercial
web
search
engines
,
where
a
cluster
of
a
thousand
or
more
computers
might
participate
in
processing
a
single
query
,
and
where
such
clusters
of
machines
might
be
replicated
hundreds
of
times
to
handle
the
query
load
(
Dean

In
this
environment
even
relatively
small
improvements
in
query
processing
efficiency
could
potentially
save
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
per
year
in
terms
of
hardware
and
energy
costs
,
and
at
the
same
time
significantly
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
.

In

the

We
describe
a
novel
hypercube
graph
representation
for
labeled
graphs
with
arbitrary
edge
weights
in
the
interval
[
0
,

This
representation
admits
graphical
models
for
weighted
adjacency
matrices
,
which
are
useful
in
a
number
of
real
world
applications
wherein
the
strength
of
connections
between
graph
nodes
is
important
.

It
enables
us
to
bring
to
bear
a
full
arsenal
of
fuzzy
set
theoretic
measures
such
as
fuzzy
subsethood
,
entropy
,
completeness
,
and
mutual
subsethood
to
the
description
of
graphs
.

Our
hypercube
representation
also
provides
a
direct
similarity
metric
between
pairs
of
graphs
,
which
is
particularly
useful
for
external
comparisons
among
sets
of
graphs
.

The
unitary
complement
of
this
similarity
metric
in
turn
provides
a
distance
metric
between
two
graphs
,
thus
enabling
us
to
perform
vector
processing
operations
on
graphs
,
e.g
clustering
,
change
detection
,
hypothesis
testing
as
to
the
independence
of
two
graphs
,
feature
extraction
for
neural
network
and/or
statistical
classifiers
,
and
antecedent
specification
for
fuzzy
mappings
.

We
derive
the
probability
mass
function
of
this
metric
for
two
independent
random
graphs
.

The
hypercube
graph
representation
finds
applications
in
problems
where
we
are
dealing
with
labeled
graphs
,
e.g
computer
networks
,
social
networks
,
graphical
information
retrieval
,
and
data
fusion
problems
involving
virtual
networks
of
events
.

Of
special
interest
are
labeled
graphs
with
fixed
vertices
whose
edges
and
their
corresponding
weights
vary
over
time
,
as
well
as
graphs
that
evolve
in
time
by
the
addition
of
new

The
CiteSeer
digital
library
stores

Although
its
main
purpose
is
to
make
it
easier
for

,
CiteSeer
has
been
proven
as
a
powerful
resource
in
many

that

The

extraction
in
CiteSeer
is
done
using
automated
techniques
.

Although
fairly
accurate
,
these
techniques
still
result
in

Since
the
performance
of

trained
on
these

highly
depends
on
the
quality
of
the

,
we
propose
an
approach
to
CiteSeer

cleaning
that
incorporates
information
from
an
external

source

The
result
is
a
subset
of

is
substantially
cleaner

goal
is
to
make
the

Similarity
measures
are
used
to
quantify
the
resemblance
of
two
sets
.

Simplest
ones
are
calculated
by
ratios
of
the
document
’s
number
of
the
compared
sets
.

These
measures
are
simple
and
usually
employed
in
first
steps
of
evaluation
studies
,
they
are
called
cardinal
measures
.

Others
measures
compare
sets
upon
the
number
of
common
documents
they
have
.

They
are
usually
employed
in
quantitative
information
retrieval
evaluations
,
some
examples
are
Jaccard
,
Cosine
,
Recall
or
Precision
.

These
measures
are
called
nominal
ones
.

There
are
more
or
less
adapted
in
function
of
the
richness
of
the
information
system
’s
answer
.

Indeed
,
in
the
past
,
they
were
sufficient
because
answers
given
by
systems
were
only
composed
by
an
unordered
set
of
documents
.

But
usual
systems
improve
the
quality
or
the
visibility
of
there
answers
by
using
a
relevant
ranking
or
a
clustering
presentation
of
documents
.

In
this
case
,
similarity
measures
are
n’t
adapted

In
this
paper
we
present
some
solu
tions
in
the
case
of

ordered
and
partially

answer
.

Introduction

The
quantitative
evaluation
of
a
system
’s
information
retrieval
process
is
often
based
upon
the
comparison
of
answers
.

For
example
,
in
large
scale
evaluation
,
system
’s
answers
are
compared
each
to
other
(
comparative
evaluation
)
or
to
a
referential
set
of
“
good
”
answer
(
diagnostic
evaluation
Hirschmann

The
calculus
of
the
similarity
between
two
answers
C
and
C’
depends
on
the
richness
of
the
information
presentation
format
.

Indeed
,
basic
information
retrieval
systems
produce
lists
of
documents
without
any
particular
order
.

Answer
sets
are
in
those
cases
compared
in
function
of
the
number
of
documents
they
have
(
cardinal
comparison
)
or
the
number
of
common
documents
they
have
(
nominal
comparison
Actual
information
retrieval
systems
propose
ranked
list
of
documents
as
answer
,
the
rank
is
given
by
the
relevance
degree
from
the
document
to
the
answer
.

It
may
be
total
or
partial
.

For
example
,
web
engines
give
a
completely
ordered
list
of
documents
as
answer
,
this
is
a
total
order
.

the

improve

In
these

are

Indeed
,
only

in

The
aim
of
this

is
to

ones

In
the
first
part
of
this

we
we

describe
the
usual
measures
proposed
in
the
case
of

tests
:
measures
based
upon
nominal

Then
,
in

we

present
the
total

formalism
,
the
property
the
similarity
measures
must
have
in
this
case
and
examples
of
possible
similarity
measures
.

In
the
third
and
last
part
we
’ll
present
the
most
general
case
,
the
partial
order
.

We
’ll
explain
why
measures
proposed
in

case
ca

used
there
and
how
we
can

We
can
noticed
that
the
partial
order
case
is
a
generalization
of
the
total
order
case
;
a

is
a
partial

with

Manifold
Ranking
(
MR
)
is
one
of
the
most
popular
graphbased
ranking
methods
and
has
been
widely
used
for
information
retrieval
.

Due
to
its
ability
to
capture
the
geometric
structure
of
the
image
set
,
it
has
been
successfully
used
for
image
retrieval
.

The
existing
approaches
that
use
manifold
ranking
rely
only
on
a
single
image
manifold
.

However
,
such
methods
may
not
fully
discover
the
geometric
structure
of
the
image
set
and
may
lead
to
poor
precision
results
.

Motivated
by
this
,
we
propose
a
novel
method
named
Multi
-
Manifold
Ranking
(
MMR
)
which
embeds
multiple
image
manifolds
each
constructed
using
a
different
image
feature
.

We
propose
a
novel
cost
function
that
is
minimized
to
obtain
the
ranking
scores
of
the
images
.

Our
proposed
multi
-
manifold
ranking
has
a
better
ability
to
explore
the
geometric
structure
of
image
set
as
demonstrated
by
our
experiments
.

Furthermore
,
to
improve
the
efficiency
of
MMR
,
a
specific
graph
called
anchor
graph
is
incorporated
into
MMR
.

The
extensive
experiments
on
real
world
image
databases
demonstrate
that
MMR
outperforms
existing
manifold
ranking
based
methods
in
terms
of
quality
and
has
comparable
running
time
to
the
fastest
MR
algorithm

As
web
contents
grow
,
the
importance
of
search
engines
become
more
critical
and
at
the
same
time
user
satisfaction
decreases
.

Query
recommendation
is
a
new
approach
to
improve
search
results
in
web
.

In
this
paper
a
method
is
proposed
that
,
given
a
query
submitted
to
a
search
engine
,
suggests
a
list
of
queries
that
are
related
to
the
user
input
query
.

The
related
queries
are
based
on
previously
issued
queries
,
and
can
be
issued
by
the
user
to
the
search
engine
to
tune
or
redirect
the
search
process
.

The
proposed
method
is
based
on
clustering
processes
in
which
groups
of
semantically
similar
queries
are
detected
.

The
clustering
process
uses
the
content
of
historical
preferences
of
users
registered
in
the
query
log
of
the
search
engine
.

This
facility
provides
queries
that
are
related
to
the
ones
submitted
by
users
in
order
to
direct
them
toward
their
required
information
.

This
method
not
only
discovers
the
related
queries
but
also
ranks
them
according
to
a
similarity
measure
.

The
method
has
been
evaluated

Although
,
the

this
leads

they

Information
retrieval
in
historical
documents
has
long
consisted
in
spotting
words
.

In
this
paper
,
we
focus
on
graphical
pattern
spotting
.

Contrary
to
object
detection
and
classification
,
where
models
of
the
object
of
interest
may
be
trained
,
pattern
spotting
does
not
rely
on
any
prior
information
regarding
the
query
,
nor
predefined
class
of
graphical
objects
.

An
offline
sliding
window
approach
may
be
suitable
,
provided
that
the
challenge
raised
by
high
computational
and
storage
costs
is
handled
.

We
propose
an
unsupervised
,
segmentation
-
free
approach
that
takes
advantage
of
recent
developments
in
computer
vision
to
overcome
these
issues
.

We
also
investigate
the
use
of
new
,
compact
descriptors
for
the
data
,
namely
the
vectors
of
locally
aggregated
descriptors
(
VLAD
)
and
Fisher
Vectors
,
instead
of
the
usual
bagof
-
visual
-
words
approach
.

Results
obtained
on
medieval
manuscripts
from
the
DocExplore
project
show
that
our
approach
achieves
better
retrieval
results
,
with
a
better
efficiency
in
terms
of
time
/
memory
,
compared
to
standard
approaches
.

Experimentations
show
that
VLAD
and
Fisher
Vectors
can
be
fruitfully
used
in
the
future
for
the
description
of
historical
documents
.

Additionally
,
we
show
that
our
system
can
be
easily
turned
into
a
word
spotting
system
with
slight
adaptation
,
and
that
it
achieves
results
comparable
to

INTRODUCTION
Sensor
networks
are
self
-
configurable
networks
,
made
of
numerous
sensors
and
linked
by
a
wireless
medium
.

These
networks
pose
many
challenges
due
to
constrained
computational
power
and
memory
size
,
bandwidth
and
energy
consumption
.

One
of
the
main
goals
in
wireless
networks
is
to
make
network
last
for
years
without
replacing
the
batteries
.

For
this
purpose
,
most
wireless
networks
utilize
a
“
sleep
-
mode
”
operation
which
turns
on
certain
nodes
at
certain
times
and
keeps
the
node
at
stand
-
by
mode
for
minimum
power
consumption
.

While
the
major
source
of
energy
consumption
in
a
network
is
data
transmissions
,
it
is
important
to
optimize
the
locations
for
network
nodes
such
that
all
the
required
locations
are
covered
and
total
energy
consumption
is
minimized
.

In
this
paper
,
we
present
techniques
for
optimization
of
node
placement
for

consumption
and
coverage
.

In
addition
,
this
ongoing
research
integrates
optimization
techniques
with
our
3D
interactive
design
system
[

shown
in
Figure

.

Although
the
existing
tools
for
network
simulation
readily
provide
many
network
simulation
and
visualization
features
,
those
tools
and
techniques
do
not
allow
users
to
interactively
design
and
simulate
a
wireless
network
in
a
3-D
immersive
environment
.

Our
integrated
design
environment
provides
an
immersive
design
capability
with
optimized
network
node
placement
capability
.

Immersive
3-D
design
tool
in
CAVE
and
the
resulting
data

The
most
commonly
used
method
for
deploying
sensor
networks
is
uniform
random
placement
,
as
it
is
perceived
to
be
the
easiest
and
lowest
cost
possibility
.

When
planning
a
WSN
installation
future
maintenance
,
creating
functional
and
robust
mesh
,
and
installation
requirements
should
be
into
the
considerations
.

In
small
buildings
like
homes
there
may
be
few
nodes
and
random
deployment
strategy
could
be
used
.

However
,
in
many
industrial
and
enterprise
applications
there
can
be
thousands
of
devices
in
the
network
.

Then
,
uniform
random
deployment
strategy
will
be
ineffective
and
also
very
inefficient
due
to
the
high
number
of
deployed
nodes
.

To
solve
this
problem
,
developing
new
algorithms
for
optimum
placement
of
network
nodes
is
necessary
.

Here
,
we
investigate
this
problem
from
two
perspectives
;
first
,
finding
optimum
3D
locations
of
nodes
and
second
,
integrate
this
optimization
scheme
into
the
immersive
environment
.

As
target
wireless
network
platform
,
we
use
an
emerging
standard
ZigBee
.

ZigBee
is
a
wireless
networking
technology
built
using
the
recent
IEEE
802.15.4
communication
standard
and
is
characterized
by
its
low
cost
,
low
power
consumption
at
a
low
data
rate
(
250
Kbps
A
ZigBee
sensor
can
be
functional
for
many
years
on
simple
battery
power
.

This
is
due
to
the
implementation
of
the
ZigBee
protocol
in
which
the
sensors
are
mostly
in
deep
sleep
or
idle
mode
to
preserve
power
consumption
.

ZigBee
specification
has
been
approved
by
ZigBee
Alliance
Board
of
Directors
(
www.zigbee.org
)
and
announced
very
recently
in
June
2005
.

The
remainder
of
the
paper
is
organized
as
follows
:

Section
2
presents
optimization
techniques
for
ZigBee
wireless
networks
,
Section

with
the

We

INDOOR

MODEL

In
order
to

,
we
use
an
in

building
site
-
specific
propagation
model
that
predicts
the
local
mean
of
power
received
at
any
given
point
.

This
model
includes
the
effect
of
buildings
type
as
well
as
the
model
including
the
effects
of
angle
of
incidence
,
polarization
,
material
dielectric
constant
,
and
antenna
patterns
caused
by
obstacles
as
described
by
Seidel
[

Seidel
’s
model
provides
flexibility
and
is
known
to
reduce
the
standard
deviation
between
measured
and
predicted
path
loss
to
around
4
dB
,
as
compared
to
13
dB
when
only
a
log
distance
model
is
used
in
two
different
buildings
.

The
model
assumes

,
nsf

,
FAF
is
the

based

PAF

Summing
the
cumulative
partition
losses
along

been

to

[

Thus
,
if
a
good
estimate
of
nsf
exists
on
the
same
floor
,
then
the
path
loss
on
a
different
floor
can
be
predicted
by
adding
an
appropriate
value
of
FAF
(
selected
from
a

values
and
then

The

model
α
is
essentially
a
3-d
ray

scheme
.

We
use
path
loss
model
as
our
cost
function
.

Cost
function
calculates
cost
of
flow
between
nodes

as

)
where
PL(dij
)
is
the
loss
power
in

at

from

i
to
node
j.

This
equation
uses
Eq
.

2
as
a
cost
function
.

Based
on
this
assumption
,
we
determine
the
optimum
3-dimensional
locations
for
network
nodes
using
linear
programming
methods
.

OPTIMIZATION

We
assume
some
of
the
nodes’
positions
are
known
a
priori
,
through
site
specific
information
.

We
randomize
other
nodes
positions
in
3D
environment
by
keeping
those
already
known
nodes’
positions
constant
.

Then
we
find
optimum
positions
of
nodes
via
our
network
flow
analysis
of
linear
programming
.

Many
physical
networks
in
communication
can
be
logically
modeled
by
network
flow
analysis
.

Therefore
,
our
method
uses

sentences
written

Given

the
problem
of

Implementing

In

we
walk
the
reader
through
our

solution
to
this
challenge
and
its
application
to
a
real

By
treating
structured

as
first

citizens
of

,
much
of
the

effort
is
pushed
from

down
to
the

Combined

this

The
proliferation
of
searchable
text
databases
on
local
area
networks
and
the
Internet
causes
the
problem
of
finding
information
that
may
be
distributed
among
many
disjoint
text
databases
i
>
distributed
information
retrieval</i
How
to
merge
the
results
returned
by
selected
databases
is
an
important
subproblem
of
the
distributed
information
retrieval
task
.

Previous
research
assumed
that
either
resource
providers
cooperate
to
provide
normalizing
statistics
or
search
clients
download
all
retrieved
documents
and
compute
normalized
scores
without
cooperation
from
resource
providers
.

This
article
presents
a
semisupervised
learning
solution
to
the
result
merging
problem
.

The
key
contribution
is
the
observation
that
information
used
to
create
resource
descriptions
for
resource
selection
can
also
be
used
to
create
a
centralized
sample
database
to
guide
the
normalization
of
document
scores
returned
by
different
databases
.

At
retrieval
time
,
the
query
is
sent
to
the
selected
databases
,
which
return
database
-
specific
document
scores
,
and
to
a
<
i
>
centralized
sample

database</i
which
returns
database
-
independent
document
scores
.

Documents
that
have
both
a
database
-
specific
score
and
a
database
-
independent
score
serve
as
training
data
for
learning
to
normalize
the
scores
of
other
documents
.

An
extensive
set
of
experiments
demonstrates
that
this
method
is
more
effective
than
the
well
-
known
CORI
result
-
merging
algorithm
under
a
variety
of

Daily
large
number
of

are
received
in
large

systems
.

Dealing
with
these
reports
manually
utilizes
time
and
resources
which
leads
to
delaying
the
resolution
of
important
bugs
.

As
an
important
process
in

,
bug

process
carefully
analyze
these
bug

to
determine
,
for
example
,
whether
the

are
duplicate
or
unique
,
important
or
unimportant
,
and
who
will
resolve
them
.

Assigning
bug
reports
based
on
their
priority
or
importance
may
play
an
important
role
in
enhancing
the
bug

process
.

The
accurate
and

prioritization
and
hence
resolution
of
these

reports
not
only
improves
the
quality
of

task
but
also
provides
the
basis
to
keep

alive

In
the
past

,
various
studies
have
been
conducted
to
prioritize
bug
reports
using
data
mining
techniques
like
classification
,
information

and
clustering
that
can
overcome
incorrect
prioritization
.

Due
to
their
popularity
and
importance
,
we
survey
the
automated
bug
prioritization
processes
in
a
systematic
way
.

In
particular
,
this

gives
a
small
theoretical
study
for
bug

to
motivate
the
necessity
for
work
on

Intelligent
and
efficient
information
retrieval
becomes
increasingly
important
.

Analogous
to
thesauri
in
the
realm
of
spatial
concepts
,
gazetteers
offer
a
controlled
vocabulary
that
can
be
used
for
spatial
queries
.

Gazetteers
use
geographic
footprints
to
link
place
names
to
geographic
locations
.

Which
geographic
footprint
representation
is
chosen
has
a
strong
impact
on
the
quality
of
spatial
queries
.

However
,
the
footprint
representations
currently
used
in
standard
gazetteers
such
as
points
,
lines
,
grid
cell
representations
,
and
bounding
boxes
do
not
offer
enough
topological
information
to
support
refined
spatial
queries
.

We
propose
a
new
type
of
spatial
footprint
that
can
be
described
as
a
qualitative
representation
of
the
spatial
decomposition
of
geographic
entities
.

It
holds
enough
topological
and
ordinal
information
enable
refined
spatial
queries
without
being
subject
to
the
constraints
of
exact
polygon
representations
.

The
proposed
spatial
representation
was
developed
to
be
combined
with
terminological
reasoning
techniques
used
in
systems
for
intelligent
information

Most
information
retrieval
systems
on
the
Internet
rely
primarily
on
similarity
ranking
algorithms
based
solely
on
term
frequency
statistics
.

Information
quality
is
usually
ignored
.

This
leads
to
the
problem
that
documents
are
retrieved
without
regard
to
their
quality
.

We
present
an
approach
that
combines
similarity
-
based
similarity
ranking
with
quality
ranking
in
centralized
and
distributed
search
environments
.

Six
quality
metrics
,
including
the
<
i

currency</i

availability</i
i
>

information
-
to
-
noise
ratio</i

authority</i

i
>
popularity</i
and
<
i
>
cohesiveness</i
were
investigated
.

Search
effectiveness
was
significantly
improved
when
the
currency
,
availability
,
information
-
to
-
noise
ratio
and
page
cohesiveness
metrics
were
incorporated
in
centralized
search
.

The
improvement
seen
when
the
availability
,
information
-
to-
noise
ratio
,
popularity
,
and
cohesiveness
metrics
were
incorporated
in
site
selection
was
also
significant
.

Finally
,
incorporating
the
popularity
metric
in
information
fusion
resulted
in
a
significant
improvement
.

In
summary
,
the
results
show
that
incorporating
quality
metrics
can
generally
improve
search
effectiveness
in
both
centralized
and
distributed
search
environments

Synchronous
Collaborative
Information
Retrieval
(
SCIR
)
is
concerned
with
supporting
two
or
more
users
who
search
together
at
the
same
time
in
order
to
satisfy
a
shared
information
need
.

SCIR
systems
represent
a
paradigmatic
shift
in
the
way
we
view
information
retrieval
,
moving
from
an
individual
to
a
group
process
and
as
such
the
development
of
novel
IR
techniques
is
needed
to
support
this
.

In
this
article
we
present
what
we
believe
are
two
key
concepts
for
the
development
of
effective
SCIR
namely
division
of
labour
(
DoL
)
and
sharing
of
knowledge
(
SoK
Together
these
concepts
enable
coordinated
SCIR
such
that
redundancy
across
group
members
is
reduced
whilst
enabling
each
group
member
to
benefit
from
the
discoveries
of
their
collaborators
.

In
this
article
we
outline
techniques
from
state

of
-
the
-
art
SCIR
systems
which
support
these
two
concepts
,
primarily
through
the
provision
of
awareness
widgets
.

We
then
outline
some
of
our
own
work
into
system
-
mediated
techniques
for
division
of
labour
and
sharing
of
knowledge
in
SCIR
.

Finally
we
conclude
with
a
discussion
on
some
possible
future
trends
for
these
two
coordination
techniques

The
Technology

task
deals
with
the
retrieval
of
information
that
can

a
scientific
question

This
task
is
more
challenging
in

to

Vienna
2015
Summit
Conference
on
the
Response
and
Responsibility
of
the
Information
Sciences
.

At
the
ICPI
,
Wu
Kun
and
others
presented
evidence
for
a
current
integration
and
convergence
of
the
philosophy
and
science
of
information
,
under
the
influence
of
the
unique
characteristics
of
information
itself
.

As
I
have
shown
,
my
extension
of
logic
to
real
systems
(
Logic
in
Reality
;
LIR
)
applies
to
and
explicates
many
of
the
properties
of
information
processes
.

In
this
paper
,
I
apply
LIR
as
a
framework
for
understanding
the
operation
of
information
in
three
areas
of
science
and
philosophy
that
were
discussed
at
the
Summit
.

The
utility
of
this
approach
in
support
of
an
information
commons
is
suggested
the
abstract
section
.


-DOCSTART-

Many
existing
information
processing
schemes
in
sensor
networks
are
based
on
multihop
in
-
network
algorithms
that
require
information
routing
and
coordination
between
nodes
and
incur
excess
overhead
in
latency
and
energy
consumption
.

In
this
paper
,
we
develop
an
alternative
and
complementary
single
-
hop
approach
active
wireless
sensing
(
AWS
in
which
a
wireless
information
retriever
(
WIR
)
queries
a
select
ensemble
of
nodes
to
obtain
desired
information
in
a
rapid
and
energy
-
efficient
manner
.

The
basic
architecture
in
AWS
consists
of:(i
)

a
WIR
,
equipped
with
an
antenna
array
,
interrogates
the
wireless
sensors
with
wideband
space
-
time
waveforms
ii
)
the
sensors
modulate
the
acquired
waveforms
with
their
(
possibly
encoded
)
measured
data
and
generate
an
ensemble
response
to
the
WIR
's
interrogation
signal
,
and
(
iii
)
the
WIR
extracts
the
sensor
data
by
exploiting
the
space
-
time
characteristics
of
the
resulting
multipath
sensing
channel
.

To
facilitate
analysis
,
we
propose
a
canonical
family
of
sensing
configurations
that
represent
a
simple
abstraction
of
spatial
correlation
in
the
signal
field
or
the
nature
of
local
cooperation
in
the
network
.

The
concept
of
source
-
channel
matching
is
introduced
in
which
the
spatio
-
temporal
resolution
is
adapted
to
the
spatial
scale
of
node
correlation
in
the
sensing
configurations
.

Signaling
strategies
and
associated
receiver
structures
at
the
WIR
are
developed
for
different
source
-
channel
matching
configurations
.

The
performance
of
AWS
is
analyzed
in
different
configurations
both
in
terms
of
reliability
and
capacity
of
information
retrieval
.


-DOCSTART-

In
this
paper
we
present

YaSemIR
,
a
free
open
-
source
Semantic
Information
Retrieval
system
based
on
Lucene
.

It
takes
one
or
more
ontologies
in
OWL
format
and
a
terminology
associated
to
each
ontology
in
SKOS
format
to
index
semantically
a
text
collection
.

The
terminology
is
used
to
annotate
concepts
in
documents
,
while
the
ontology
is
used
to
exploit
the
taxonomic
information
in
order
to
expand
these
with
their
subsumers
.

YaSemIR
is
a
flexible
system
that
may
be
configured
to
work
with
different
ontologies
,
on
various
types
of
documents
.

Few

learning
refers
to
understanding
new
concepts
from
only
a
few
examples
.

We
propose
an
information
retrieval
-
inspired
approach
for
this
problem
that
is
motivated
by
the
increased
importance
of
maximally
leveraging
all
the
available
information
in
this
low
-
data
regime
.

We
define
a
training
objective
that
aims
to
extract
as
much
information
as
possible
from
each
training
batch
by
effectively
optimizing
over
all
relative
orderings
of
the
batch
points
simultaneously
.

In
particular
,
we
view
each
batch
point
as
a
‘
query’
that
ranks
the
remaining
ones
based
on
its
predicted
relevance
to
them
and
we
define
a
model
within
the
framework
of
structured
prediction
to
optimize
mean
Average
Precision
over
these
rankings
.

Our
method
achieves
impressive
results
on
the
standard
few
-
shot
classification
benchmarks
while
is
also
capable
of
few
-
shot
retrieval
.

FECUNDITY
AND
VARIATION
IN
POPULATIONS
OF
SALT
MARSH
SONG

Over
85
%
of
tidal
salt
marsh
habitat
has
been
lost
in
the
San
Francisco
Bay
Estuary
in
the
past
150
years
.

Evaluating
the
stability
of
birds
nesting
in
the
marsh
relies
on
measures
of
reproductive
success
;
however
,
nest

calculations
may
be
misleading
for

species
,
species
with
a
propensity
to
re
-
nest
after
nest
-
failure
,
or
for
populations
suffering
high
rates
of

.

Seasonal

INTRACLUTCH
COMPARISON
OF
MERCURY
ALLOCATION

INTO
EGGS
OF
TREE
SWALLOWS
(
TACHYCINETA
BICOLOR
)

An
experimental
tree
swallow
(
Tachycineta
bicolor
)
population
was
established
in
the
headwaters
of
the
Shenandoah
River
,
Virginia
,
to
assess
the
accumulation
and
effects
of
legacy
mercury
contamination
in
one
of
the
tributaries
,
the
South
River
.

Mercury
contamination
of
eggs
is
suspected
as
a
major
cause
of
reproductive
impairment
in
wild
birds
.

Large
piscivores
can
differentially
allocate
mercury
into
eggs
within
a
clutch
;
the
first
egg
having
higher
mercury
than
the
last
.

Intraclutch
variation
has
not
been
well
studied
in
free
-
living
,
insectivorous
songbirds
that
lay
larger
clutches
.

Previous
studies
along
the
South
River
found
tree
swallows
to
have
the
highest
blood
mercury
levels
reported
in
this
species
;
these
swallows
subsequently
produced
fewer
fledglings
than
reference
birds
.

The
objective
of
the
current
study
is
to
determine
whether
an
insectivorous
songbird
,
the
tree
swallow
,
differentially
allocates
mercury
into
each
egg
within
the
clutch
.

Eggs
from
15
-
20
clutches
will
be
numbered
in
laying
sequence
,
collected
upon
clutch
completion
,
and
analyzed
individually
for
mercury
.

Additional
study
will
address
correlations
with
female
blood
mercury
level
to
aid
in
establishing
inter
-
tissue
comparative
ratios
.

The
importance
of
social
cues
in
the
regulation
of
breeding
life
history
stages
varies
according
to
the
type
of
mating
system
as
well
as
the
environmental
conditions
.

In
socially
monogamous
species
,
the
duration
of
the
breeding
season
often
dictates
the
influence
of
social
cues
on
regulation
of
breeding
.

Testosterone
can
act
as
a
mediator
between
social
interactions
and
breeding
stage
.

In
this
work
,
we
explore
how
two
congeneric
species
that
inhabit
similar
environments
in
different
hemispheres
modulate
testosterone
and
aggressive
behavior
in
response
to
social
challenges
.

In
North
America
,
simulated
territorial
intrusions
(
STIs
)
were
conducted
on
<
em
>
Zonotrichia
leucophrys

nuttalli</em
>
around
Bodega
Bay
,
California
.

For
comparison
,
we
conducted
STIs
on
Z.
capensis
chilensis
near
Santiago
,
Chile
.

At
both
sites
we
concurrently
collected
baseline
testosterone
samples
.

We
found
that
unlike
<
em

Z.l.nuttalli</em
em
>

Z.c.chilensis</em
>
do
not
increase
testosterone
levels
during
the
mid
-
breeding
season
in
response
to
STIs
.

Here
we
investigate
the
implications
of
these
physiological
and
behavior
results
on
the
breeding
life
history
stage
of
sister
species
in
similar
environments

TRANSLATING

CONSERVATION
:

RESEARCH
NEEDS
FOR
MANAGING
BIRDS
USING
THE
CONSPECIFIC
ATTRACTION

As
knowledge
advances
regarding
how
social
information
affects
avian
habitat
selection
,
it
is
important
to
consider
how
research
findings
translate
into
conservation
practice
and
how
basic
researchers
can
provide
a
knowledge
base
appropriate
to
conservation
.

Although
conservation
decisions
sometimes
can
not
wait
for
scientific
research
,
it
is
important
that
scientists
begin
to
fill
in
the
gaps
of
understanding
as
managers
begin
to
implement
conspecific
playback
as
a
conservation
tool
to
insure
that
such
manipulations
are
working
for
the
good
of
the
managed
species
.

Here
we
highlight
four
areas
of
social
information
research
that
we
believe
require
further
examination
to
understand
conspecific
attraction
and
its
use
as
a
conservation
tool
:
1
)
species
-
specific
variation
in
underlying
mechanisms
of
conspecific
attraction
,
2
)
relative
importance
of
social
and
structural
habitat
cues
in
habitat
selection
,
3
)
differences
within
a
species
across
its
geographic
range
,
and
4
)
the
consequences
of
drawing
birds
into
previously
unoccupied
habitat
using
playbacks

FOREST
BIRD
USE
OF
RIPARIAN
BUFFER
STRIPS
AND
CONTINUOUS
FOREST
IN
NOVA
SCOTIA
AND
ITS
MANAGEMENT
IMPLICATIONS
Use
of
riparian
buffer
strips
in
comparison
to
continuous
upland
and
riparian
forest
was
assessed
for
27
forest
bird
species
of
conservation
concern
in
Nova
Scotia
.

During
the
2006
breeding
season
,
15
transects
were
surveyed
3
times
in
each
of
3
treatments
matched
for
forest
type
and
region
:
riparian
buffers
,
riparian
reference
forest
,
and
upland
reference
forest
.

Buffers
had
fewer
target
individuals
and
species
than
references
and
were
dominated
by
open
/
edge
species
,
which
were
uncommon
in
reference
forest
.

Upland
and
riparian
references
had
similar
combined
abundances
of
target
species
.

More
of
these
species
preferred
upland
forest
,
but
some
were
more
abundant
in
riparian
forest
.

Some
target
species
were
not
found
in
any
buffers
,
and
some
were
absent
from
narrow
buffers
.

Rather
than
a
linear
relationship
between
buffer
width
and
bird
abundance
or
species
richness

,
results
suggest
a
threshold
at
40
m
.

Management
recommendations
include
maintaining
both
upland
and
riparian
forest
,
and
increasing
minimum
buffer
width
from
20
m
to
40
m
.

Ongoing
analyses
are
examining
the
influence
of
other
factors
,
including
forest
type
,
stream
type
,
and
surrounding
landscape

begin
incubation
prior
to
clutch
completion
.

Early
onset
of
incubation
may
be
an
adaptive
strategy
to
maximize
the
number
or
quality
of
young
produced
within
a
nest
.

However
,
the
egg
viability
hypothesis
predicts
that
birds
should
begin
incubation
earlier
in
the
laying
period
so
that
early
-
laid
eggs
have
reduced
exposure
to
potentially
harmful
ambient
temperatures
,
thus
minimizing
hatching
failure
.

We
studied
the
effect
of
longer
exposure
to
increased
ambient
temperatures
between
a
suburban
and
wildland
site
on
the
incubation
behavior
of
Florida
Scrub
-
Jays
.

First
-
laid
eggs
in
the
suburbs
that
experienced
increased
exposure
to
warmer
ambient
temperatures
had
higher
rates
of
hatching
failure
,
as
predicted
by
the
egg
viability
hypothesis
.

As
temperatures
increased
seasonally
,
scrub
-
jays
in
both
sites
began
incubation
earlier
in
the
laying
period
,
possibly
to
decrease
exposure
of
first
-
laid
eggs
and
minimize
hatching
failure
.

However
,
early
incubation
onset
also
increased
hatching
asynchrony
within
clutches
.

Thus
,
a
tradeoff
may
exist
between
beginning
incubation
early
to
decrease
hatching
failure
in
first
-
laid
eggs
at
the
cost
of
increased
hatching
asynchrony
and
brood
reduction
.

Many

.

However
,
the

We

and
will
be
radio

approximately
30
adult

during
the
2008
breeding
season
to
investigate
when
and
why
chats
engage
in
extra

territorial
forays
.

Data
from
2007
suggests
that
chats
regularly
engage
in
forays
,
nesting
failure
is
common
,
and
both
males
and
females
may
abandon
territories
after
nest
failure
.

Results
from
the
2008
breeding
season
will
be
presented
.

We
will
also
discuss
how

ANALYSES

To

the
Klamath
Bird
Observatory
conducted
VCP
point
counts
in
oak
woodlands
where
fuels
reduction

had
been
implemented
.

Using
these

I
compared
bird
abundance
in
treated

untreated
management
units
with
general

)
and
Program
DISTANCE
.

In
DISTANCE
,
models
that
account
for
differences
in
detectability
between
treated
and
untreated
units
were
chosen
as
the
most
competitive
based
on
AIC
scores
in
under
half
of
the
species
-
by

treatment
model
sets
considered
.

I
compared
the
patterns
of
abundance
that
resulted
from
these
models
with
the
results
from
GLMs
and
found
them
to
be
similar
.

I
will
consider
the
biological
significance
of
alternative
analysis
results
with
regards
to
our
responsibility
to
deliver
sound
science
that
informs
land

The

explain
the

Males

During
the

males

We
used

the

of
a
migratory

in

Columbia
,
and
we
examined
genetic
and
phenotypic
variation
between
populations
across
the
migratory

.

Sequence
data
from

indicate
there
is
a
contact
zone
between
divergent
clades
in
British

The
mitochondrial
clades
are
approximately
2

and
show
evidence

providing
support
for
the
secondary

hypothesis
in

Analysis
of
SNPs

and
intron
sequences
also
reveal
significant
variation
across
the
migratory

These

a
high
level

FORECASTING
AVIFAUNAL
CONSEQUENCES
OF
GLOBAL
CLIMATE
CHANGE
Predicted
global
climate
changes
represent
a
main
threat
to
species
ability
to
persist
under
future
climates
.

As
such
,
understanding
how
species
distributions
and
population
dynamics
will
respond
to
changes
in
climate
pose
a
main
challenge
for
biodiversity
conservation
.

Because
ecological
niches
are
evolutionarily
stable
constraints
to
species
distribution
,
long
-
term
responses
and
maintenance
of
evolutionary
processes
will
rely
on
the
availability
of
suitable
areas
for
species
in
the
future
.

Here
I
review
ca
.

20
years
of
studies
aimed
at
forecasting
avifaunal
consequences
of
climate
change
.

Results
were
summarized
for
species
groups
considering
habitat
specificity
,
dispersal
ability
and
location
of
present
day
distributions
.

Most
studies
focused
at
single
species
or
communities
,
and
considered
recent
past
changes
in
climates
for
estimates
;
whereas
few
compared
multi
-
species
responses
in
ecosystem
dimensions
,
via
ecological
niche
modeling
and
available
data
sets
of
specimen
collections
.

Negative
effects
were
found
or
predicted
in
most
avifauna
scenarios
,
but
dispersal
abilities
and
topography
of
current
distributions
exhibited
most
pronounced
effects
on
species
resilience
to
climate
changes
.

The
second
method
is
more
helpful
to
predict
corridors
and
specie
-
areas
relationships
under
future
climates

CENSUS
METHODS
FOR
CANOPY
BIRDS
IN
LOWLAND

TROPICAL
FORESTS
Assemblages
of
birds
that
live
high
in
forest
canopies
are
poorly
known
because
of
the
difficulty
of
viewing
canopy
birds
from
the
ground
or
accessing
the
forest
canopy
to
view
birds
at
eye
level
.

Past
studies
of
canopy
birds
have
relied
on
a
single
method
,
principally
repeat
counts
from
one
to
three
vantage
points
above
the
forest
canopy
.

I
used
three
methods
to
census
canopy
birds
in
a
100-ha
plot
in
Pico
Bonito
National
Park
,
Honduras
:
28
repeat
counts
from
two
trees
,
28
single
counts
from
28
trees
,
and
ground
point
transects
(
n
27
)
encompassing
30
points
.

I
observed
124
bird
species
in
the
forest
canopy
using
all
methods
,
87
of
which
I
define
as
core
canopy
species
for
the
study
area
.

Richness
of
core
canopy
species
as
estimated
by
ground
methods
was
significantly
lower
than
that
produced
by
either
canopy
method
.

The
two
canopy
-
based
methods
did
not
differ
significantly
from
each
other
.

Differences
in
estimates
for
relative
abundance
,
evenness
and
dominance
will
be
discussed
,
as
well
as
recommendations
for
designing
census
programs
for
canopy
birds
in
tropical
forests

currently
being

as
a
major

The

utilizes
a

to
create
a
series
of
impoundments
with
salinities
ranging
from

A
50

being
evaluated
to
assess
the
suitability
of
this
concept
for
migratory
birds
.

The
results
will
be
provided
to
restoration
program
managers
.

Beginning
in
2006
,
bird
use
was
monitored
at
the
saline
habitat
ponds

Bird
densities
differed
from
the
SHP
by

%
while
species

as
major

DEVELOPMENTAL
CONDITIONS
AND
FUTURE
REPRODUCTIVE
PERFORMANCE
:
A
PHYSIOLOGICAL
BASIS
?

In
vertebrates
,
developmental
conditions
result
in
fitness
consequences
lasting
the
entire
lifespan
(
i.e.
long
-
term
carry
-
over
effect

Thus
,
it
has
been
suggested
that
birds
are
not
able
to
reproduce
effectively
after
having
experienced
stressful
developmental
conditions
.

Ecologists
have
aimed
to
understand
the
proximate
factors
involved
in
such
long
-
term
carry
-
over
effect
,
and
they
have
reported
several
morphological
and
behavioral
consequences
of
stressful
developmental
conditions
.

However
,
the
long
-
term
physiological
consequences
of
stressful
developmental
conditions
are
still
poorly
known
in
free
-
living
birds
.

It
is
likely
that
developmental
conditions
orientate
the
physiology
of
individuals
in
a
specific
way
,
and
,
therefore
,
potentially
constrain
the
ability
of
individuals
to
respond
effectively
to
specific
environmental
conditions
later
in
life
.

First
,
I
will
review
some
phenotypic
and
cohort
consequences
of
stressful
developmental
conditions
in
free
-
living
bird
populations
.

Second
,
I
will
detail
how
developmental
conditions
can
affect
the
development
of
physiological
processes
(
metabolism
,
endocrine
mechanisms
,
etc
and
how
it
could
affect
the
ability
of
individuals
to
survive
and
to
breed
during
adulthood
.

Finally
,
we
will
discuss
new
ideas
and
perspectives
that
could
help
to
improve
our
understanding
of
these
long
-
term
carry
-
over
effects

EFFECTS
OF
RADIOTRANSMITTERS
ON
RETURN
RATES
OF
SWAINSON
'S
WARBLERS

Although
radiotelemetry
can
provide
much
information
on
the
behavior
and
ecology
of
birds
,
this
technique
may
negatively
affect
individuals
that
carry

Here
,
we
assess
the
potential
negative
effects
of
transmitters
on
the
following
-
year
return
rates
for
a
medium
-
sized
wood
warbler
.

In
2005
and
2006
,
we
used
glue
to
attach
0.42-g
transmitters
to
40
male
Swainson

Limnothlypis
swainsonii</em
at
two
study
sites
in
Arkansas
,
St.
Francis
National

and
White

.

We
then
compared
the
following
-
year
return
rates
of
these
birds
to
the
returns
of
birds
that
were
captured
and
color

banded
,
but
did
not
receive

.

Return
rates
for
all
birds
ranged
between

DISTRIBUTION
-
ABUNDANCE
PATTERNS
IN
THE
SUBORDER
FURNARIIDA
IN
THE
BRAZILIAN
ATLANTIC
FOREST
Understanding
the
relationship
of
distribution
and
abundance
is
a
fundamental
goal
in
ecology
.

Prior
studies
have
shown
that
distribution
and
abundance
are
often
related
,
but
with
different
strenght
in
different
systems
.

Here
we
examine
this
question
for
a
large
dataset
from
three
forest
types
(
mixed
ombrophylous
forest
,
seasonal
semidecidous
forest
,
and
dense
ombrophylous
forest)in
southern
Brazil
,
including
both
continuous
forest
and
fragments
.

The
dataset
consists
of
point
counts
in
49
sites
,
including
data
for
59
species
.

We
use
a
novel
non
-
parametric
technique
applied
to
these
data
to
show
that
there
are
pronounced
differences
in
the
distribution
-
abundance
patterns
among
different
families
in
Furnariida
(
with
many
different
species
-
specific
patterns
)
across
forest
types
,
and
in
fragmented
versus
continuous
habitats
.

We
argue
that
these
differences
in
distribution
-
abundance
patterns
may
reflect
basic
differences
in
foraging
ecology
of
these
taxa
.

The
technique
we
present
provide
a
useful
tool
for
describing
the
pattern
of
sensitivity
to
fragmentation
and
for
suggesting
hidden
pattern
of
heterogeneity
in
habitat
use
.

SEASONAL
TEMPERATURE
DIFFERENCES

INSIDE
AND
OUTSIDE
MONK

PARAKEET
NESTS
IN
THE
CHICAGO
AREA
Monk
Parakeets
have
successfully
colonized
areas
with
colder
climates
than
those
in
their
native
range
.

Their
elaborate
stick
nests
,
which
they
use
year
-
round
,
may
provide
a
favorable
microclimate
during
harsh
winters
.

Using
a
thermistor
probe
on
a
7.6-m
telescoping
pole
,
we
sought
to
quantify
temperature
differences
inside
and
outside
monk
parakeet
nests
(
N=9
)
near
Chicago
,
IL
.

We
measured
temperatures
at
dawn
and
dusk
when
the
birds
were
most
likely
to
be
roosting
in
their
nest
chambers
.

When
possible
,
we
measured
temperatures
while
birds
were
in
the
nest
or
immediately
after
they
flew
out
of
it
.

We
also
recorded
number
of
birds
exiting
each
chamber
to
examine
relationships
with
temperatures
.

Finally
,
we
compared
temperature
differences
between
nests
in
deciduous
(
N=5
)
and
evergreen
trees
(

N=4
While
interiors
were
significantly
warmer
than
exteriors
,
the
difference
was
only
0.4&#176;C.
Temperatures
varied
between
tree
types
based
on
season
,
and
interior
and
exterior
temperatures
did
not
correlate
with
the
number
of
birds
exiting
nest
chambers
.

This
first
study
of
nest
temperatures
in
free
-
living
Monk
Parakeets
provides
little
evidence
that
nests
provide
much
direct
temperature
benefit
.

DEMOGRAPHIC
DRIVERS
AND
GEOGRAPHIC
BARRIERS

TO
DISPERSAL
IN
THE
SONG
SPARROW

(
MELOSPIZA
MELODIA
MORPHNA
)

Theory
suggests
that
dispersal
affects
the
potential
for
local
evolution
but
the
ecological
factors
affecting
dispersal
and
differentiation
in
local
populations
are
rarely
known
.

We
use
data
from
island
populations
to
show
that
immigration
by
female
and
male
song
sparrows
responded
differently
to
variation
in
adult
sex
ratio
and
population
density
,
supporting
the
hypothesis
that
intra
-
sexual
competition
for
breeding
resources
drives
dispersal
.

Female
dispersers
were
also
more
common
than
males
,
presumably
because
their
low
average
survival
led
to
surpluses
in
breeding
vacancies
.

Nevertheless
,
demographic
and
genetic
data
suggested
that
dispersal
occurred
most
often
over
short
distances
and
declined
as
populations
became
more
isolated
.

We
use
these
results
to
consider
the
influence
of
dispersal
on
the
evolution
of
breeding
date
,
and
suggest
that
locally
adapted
traits
will
arise
most
rapidly
in
semi
-
isolated
population
‘
sources
where
high
local
reproduction
and
survival
rates
reduce
immigration
and
gene
flow
.

Females
in
heated
boxes
increased
time
spent
incubating
and
maintained
higher
on
-
bout
and
off

egg
temperatures
.

This
indicates
that
female
energetic
constraints
,
not
maximizing
developmental
conditions
of
offspring
,
determines
incubation
investment
.

Females
incubating
in
cooled
nests
showed
the
opposite
response
;
they
reduced
time
spent
incubating
and
allowed
egg
temperatures
to
drop
relative
to
control
females
.

Reduction
in
egg
temperature
was
correlated
with
extended
incubation
periods
and
greater
hatching
asynchrony
and
led
to
reduced
nestling
immune
function
.

Feather
-
clipped
females
also
showed
reduction
in
time
spent
incubating
and
egg
temperatures
.

Taken
as
a
whole
,
these
experiments
demonstrate
that
energetic
demands
during
incubation
drive
female
investment
strategies
and
that
experimentally
modifying
incubation
costs
leads
to
changes
in
developmental
conditions
for
embryos
that
can
carry
over
to
the
nestling
stage

ABUNDANCE

OF
THE
MILITARY
MACAW
IN
SOUTHERN
MEXICO
.

The
Military
Macaw
em
>

militaris</em
is
an
endangered
species
with
a
highly
fragmented
distribution
that
nests
in
trees
and
cliffs
and
is
considered
to
inhabit
humid
semi
-
deciduous
forest
.

Here
we
present
a
three
year
study
considering
variation
in
abundances
,
reproductive
output
and
food
consumption
in
a
dry
region
in
southern
Mexico
.

We
observed
between
60
and
80
individuals
that
rest
and
breed
in
the
Sabino
Canyon
,
Santa
Maria
Tecomavaca
,
Oaxaca
,
Mexico
.

Macaws
were
more
abundant
in
the
canyon
from
March
to
September
.

Breeding
season
occurred
between
March
and
October
.

Considerable
variation
in
bird
abundances
among
years
was
found
.

We
documented
the
presence
of
30
potential
cavities
,
5
active
nests
during
the
first
year
,
and
observed
two
flying
juveniles
produced
.

Following
years
two
and
one
juveniles
were
produced
.

Reproductive
output
was
apparently
low
with
few
pairs
breeding
and
few
young
observed
.

Macaws
presented
an
specialized
diet
consisting
of
9
plant
species
.

Plant
fruits
and
seeds
had
considerable
high

COSTS
AND
BENEFITS
OF
SOCIAL
INFORMATION
:

BREEDING
HABITAT
SELECTION
IN
THE
NORTHERN
WHEATEAR

Because
habitat
quality
affects
fitness
individuals
are
expected
to
settle
at
the
best
habitats
.

But
identification
of
habitat
quality
is
constrained
by
various
factors
.

Social
cues
(
e.g.
presence
or
reproductive
performance
of
conspecifics
)
can
reduce
constraints
:
they
provide
more
direct
information
on
fitness
related
factors
than
e.g.
physical
cues
,
and
may
come
at
low
cost
.

In
the
northern
wheatear
floaters
and
failed
breeders
settled
at
summer
sites
overlapping
with
territories
of
breeding
pairs
,
and
chose
this
site
as
breeding
territory
in
year
t+1
.

Sites
were
selected
based
on
a
physical
habitat
characteristic
and
breeding
success
of
the
resident
pair
.

However
,
a
majority
of
the
breeding
population
stayed
close
to
their
breeding
site
during
the
post
-
breeding
season
.

Observed
movements
were
not
related
to
private
or
neighbor
breeding
success
.

Nevertheless
,
failed
breeders
moved
to
a
new
site
in
year
t+1
.

Data
suggest
that
the
location
of
the
breeding
site
is
mainly
determined
at
arrival
in
year
t+1
,
and
costs
of
post
-
breeding
movements
often
outweigh
potential
benefits
.

Thus
,
use
of
social
information
may
often
be
restricted
to
only
particular
individuals
experiencing
lower
costs
.

COLONIZATION
OF
MAINLAND
AGRICULTURAL
HABITATS
BY
AVIAN
RIVER
-
ISLAND
SPECIALISTS
ALONG
THE
AMAZON
RIVER
IN
PERU

Among
the
birds
found
on
river
islands
in
western
Amazonia
are
several
species
that
were
formerly
considered
to
be
restricted
to
early
-
successional
habitats
on
river
islands
.

I
found
some
of
these
river
-
island
specialists
at
mainland
sites
near
Iquitos
,
Peru
,
although
at
lower
densities
than
on
adjacent
islands
.

I
investigated
whether
human
habitat
disturbance
has
been
an
important
factor
in
allowing
birds
that
were
formerly
restricted
to
river
islands
to
recently
colonize
the
mainland
.

Human
habitat
disturbance
related
to
expanding
agricultural
activity
mimics
the
natural
disturbance
regime
on
islands
and
creates
early
-
successional
habitats
on
the
mainland
.

River
-
island
specialists
make
greater
use
of
such
agricultural
habitats
on
the
mainland
than
on
islands
.

Because
these
early
-
successional
habitats
on
the
mainland
are
not
readily
colonized
by
mainland
forest
birds
,
they
can
be
exploited
by
river
-
island
specialists
.

Although
river
-
island
specialists
benefit
from
low
levels
of
human
disturbance
at
mainland
sites
immediately
adjacent
to
the
river
,
they
are
unwilling
to
disperse
overland
to
reach
human
-
disturbed
habitats
far
from
the
river
,
and
they
remain
threatened
by
human
alteration
of
the
hydrological
regime
.

The

Carduelini
,
grouping
with
canaries
(

OF
MIGRATING
BIRDS
THROUGH
SOUTHERN
TEXAS
.

Southern
Texas
is
an
important
corridor
for
migrating
birds
and
has
been
the
subject
of
recent
development
interest
.

Yet
,
it
is
poorly
understood
how
migrant
birds
are
using
stopover
habitats
in
this
region
.

We
investigated
migration
chronology
and
stopover
habitat
use
by
birds
in
southern
Texas
to
provide
information
to
aid
management
decisions
.

We
compared
species
richness
and
density
of
migrating
birds
in
seven
habitats
within
three
counties
in
southern
Texas
.

Avian
surveys
were
conducted
along
500
m
transects
during
spring
and
fall
of
2006
and
2007
.

Species
Richness
and
density
were
used
as
indicators
of
habitat
use
.

Species
richness
was
greatest
in
brush
(
93
)
and
lowest
in
grasslands
(
49
Density
of
birds
was
greatest
in
oak
islands
(
mean
16.93
birds
/
ha
and
lowest
in
grasslands
(
mean
6.71
birds
/
ha

Some
migrant
groups
showed
seasonal
differences
in
density
by
habitat
.

Spring
densities
were
greater
for
flycatchers
(
3.7
times
greater
)
and
warblers
(
1.8
times
greater
)
in
Oak
Islands
compared
to
fall
.

Peak
spring
migration
occurred
mid
-
late
April
.

Fall
migration
was
more
protracted
with
peaks
in
mid
-
September
and
late
October
to
early
November
.

LACK
OF
BIAS
IN
PARENTAL
INVESTMENT
IN
THE
SEXES

BY
GREATER
SAGE
-
GROUSE
EM

CENTROCERCUS

UROPHASIANUS</EM

Based
on
Trivers
and
Willard
's
maternal
condition
hypothesis
,
we
hypothesized
that
female
Greater
Sage
-
Grouse
in
good
condition
should
bias
their
investment
in
young
to
favor
males
by
either
(
1
)
producing
more
male
offspring
or
(
2
)
allocating
a
greater
amount
of
resources
to
male
offspring
.

To
test
these
hypotheses
we
examined
relationships
between
brood
sex
ratios
and
measures
of
maternal
condition
,
as
well
as
relationships
between
gender
of
offspring
and
measures
of
maternal
investment
.

We
found
only
weak
support
for
an
effect
of
maternal
condition
on
the
number
of
male
offspring
.

Relative
hatch
date
was
the
best
predictor
of
sex
ratio
,
but
did
not
differ
from
zero(-0.13
0.14

We
found
effects
of
maternal
condition
on
allocation
of
resources
to
be
imprecise
and
variable
.

Earlier
nesting
females
tended
to
increase
their
investment
in
males
,
consistent
with
the
maternal
condition
hypothesis
,
although
effects
were
small
and
confidence
intervals
overlapped
zero
.

We
conclude
that
our
results
do
not
support
the
maternal
condition
hypothesis
for
sage
grouse
,
although
we
can
not
rule
out
the
possibility
that
other
measures
of
female
quality
might
perform
better
than
those
we
examined
.

DISTRIBUTION

IN

HAWAII
TO
NEW
CALEDONIA

Both
population
declines
and
dramatic
changes
in
the
altitudinal
distribution
of
native
Hawaiian
forest
birds
have
been
tied
closely
to
the
introduction
of
mosquito
vectors
,
avian
malaria
em
>
Plasmodium
relictum</em
and
avian
pox
virus
em

Avipoxvirus
spp
em
to
the
Hawaiian
islands
.

In
this
presentation
,
we
will
discuss
how
biotic
components
of
this
disease
system
interact
with
temperature
and
rainfall
across
steep
altitudinal
gradients
in
Hawaii
,
affecting
mosquito
dynamics
and
vector
-
borne
transmission
,
with
subsequent
impacts
on
endemic
forest
birds
.

By
contrast
,
forest
birds
from
the
less
isolated
archipelagos
of
the
southwestern
Pacific
(
American
Samoa
to
New
Caledonia
)
have
an
indigenous
fauna
of
vector
-
borne
blood
parasites
and
may
not
face
the
same
risks
from
introduction
of
avian
malaria
.

Keys
to
sustaining
the
remaining
diversity
of
the
endemic
Hawaiian
avifauna
likely
lie
at
the
extremes
of
altitudinal
gradients
of
disease
transmission
,
both
in
the
lowlands
where
natural
selection
is
fostering
evolution
of
disease
resistance
and
in
remaining
high
elevation
refugia
where
restoration
efforts
are
seeking
to
improve
and
expand
habitat

REMOVING
THE
EFFECT
OF
PARENTAL
ATTENDANCE
ON
INCUBATION
PERIODS
OF
TROPICAL
BIRDS

:
A
COMMON
GARDEN
EXPERIMENT
Tropical
species
tend
to
have
longer
incubation
periods
and
larger
relative
egg
mass
than
do
temperate
birds
.

These
traits
are
often
associated
with
parental
strategies
of
lower
adult
attendance
during
incubation
.

In
tropical
birds
,
adults
may
minimize
activity
at
the
nest
to
reduce
exposure
to
time
-
dependent
mortality
and
energetic
costs
of
reproduction
.

Additionally
,
in
many
passerines
some
incubation
occurs
before
the
completion
of
the
clutch
.

We
controlled
for
the
effect
of
adult
attendance
by
artificially
incubating
eggs
from
wild
tropical
songbirds
under
constant
temperature
and
humidity
.

We
hypothesized
that
if
long
incubation
periods
,
observed
in
tropical
birds
,
are
caused
by
lower
adult
attendance
then
artificially
incubated
eggs
that
are
not
subject
to
this
temperature
variation
will
have
shorter
incubation
periods
than
naturally
incubated
eggs
.

Our
results
indicate
that
,
for
all
species
in
this
study
,
incubation
periods
of
artificially
incubated
eggs
were
not
accelerated
and
typically
did
not
differ
in
duration
from
those
observed
within
the
nest
.

These
results
suggest
that
embryonic
development
among
the
species
included
in
this
study
may
be
limited
by
some
,
as
yet
,
unidentified
constraint
and
not
parental
attendance
.

We
simulated

THE
SINGING
BEHAVIOR
OF
THE
NEW

GREY
WARBLER
EM

GERYGONE
IGATA</EM

This
study
was
undertaken
to
investigate
the
singing
behavior
of
male
Grey
Warblers
.

The
Grey
Warbler
is
a
small
native
New
Zealand
song
bird
that
occupies
both
native
as
well
as
non
-
native
forests
.

Only
males
of
the
species
sing
.

The
songs
used
in
this
study
were
recorded
in
Kowhai
Bush
,
a
small
patch
of
native
forest
near
the
town
of
Kaikoura
on
the
east
coast
of
South
Island
,
New
Zealand
.

The
recordings
were
digitized
and
analyzed
using
the
program
RAVEN
.

Each
male
had
a
warbling
song
,
the
pitch
of
which
was
between
3
and
5
kHz
.

A
bout
of
singing
consisted
of
a
series
of
simple
introductory
notes
followed
by
two
complex
phrases
(
phrase
A
and
phrase
B
)
which
were
alternated
until
the
male
stopped
singing
.

Each
male
sang
a
highly
stereotyped
song
.

Within
Kowhai
Bush
all
males
sang
very
similar
songs
.

Kowhai
Bush
songs
were
different
from
those
sung
from
other
locations

BIRDS
ON
THE
ISLAND
OF
OAHU

Little
is
known
about
the
origin
of
avian
chewing
lice
(
Phthiraptera
)
in
Hawaii
.

Lice
have
rarely
been
detected
on
Hawaiian
honeycreepers
(
Fringillidae
:
Drepanidinae
)
in
diverse
and
intensive
bird
banding
studies
.

We
investigated
the
prevalence
of
avian
lice
on
the
Island
of
Oahu
at
six
study
sites
from
March
2007-January
2008
.

Pole
based
mist
nets
were
used
to
capture
1016
birds
.

All
birds
were
visually
examined
for
mites
and
lice
.

Community

prevalence
exhibited
seasonal
variation
.

Prevalence
was
lowest
following
the
peak
of
the
breeding
period
and
highest
late
into
the
molting
season
.

Over
the
entire
study
period
,
native
host
species
had
significantly
higher
prevalence
of
ectoparasites
than
introduced
species
(
0.95
vs

The
prevalence
of
ectoparasites
on
the
native
amakihi
(
Hemignathus
flavus
)
and
apapane
(

Himatione

)
on
the
Island
of
Oahu
was
significantly
higher
than
the
prevalence
of
ectoparasites
on
their
related
forms
on
the
Island
of
Hawaii
(
0.96
vs
0.38
for
amakihi
,
1.0
vs
0.41
for

Morphological
and
molecular
studies
are
necessary
for
determining
the
origin
and
specificity
of
avian
lice
in

Divergent
selection
on
traits
involved
in
local
adaptation
and

mating
signals
can
facilitate
population
divergence
.

Because
of
its
links
to
foraging
morphologies
and
cultural
inheritance
,
bird
song
can
contribute
strongly
to
maintenance
of
local
adaptations
.

In
two
adjacent
habitats
native
Sonoran
desert
and
urban
areas
house
finches
forage
on
seeds
that
are
highly
distinct
in
size
and
hardness
and
require
different
bite
forces
and
bill
morphologies
.

We
first
document

on

and
find
adaptive
modifications
of
bill

and
associated

in

the
two

.

Second
,
we
document
that

,
is
accelerated
in

Further
,
we
show
that

being
geographically

,
urban

desert
populations
are
nevertheless
genetically
distinct
corroborating
findings
of

Taken
together
,
these

suggest
that
divergent

on

and
development
of
traits
involved
in
production
of

,
in
combination
with
localized
learning
of

,
can
be
very
effective
at
maintaining

even
at

and
in

LONG

HOODED
WARBLER
NEST

SUCCESS
IN
SOUTHERN
ONTARIO

I
evaluated
factors
affecting
Hooded
Warbler
nest
success
at
two
sites
in
southern
Ontario
from
1988
-
2007
.

There
was
a
strong
seasonal
pattern
in
nest
success
that
was
apparent
at
both
sites
and
did
not
vary
among
years
.

Nest
survival
tended
to
be
lowest
early
in
the
season
,
peaked
mid
-
season
and
then
subsequently
declined
late
in
the
season
.

Concurrent
with
this
pattern
was
strong
seasonal
decline
in
the
probability
of
a
nest
being
parasitized
.

Nests
that
were
parasitized
by
cowbirds
suffered
from
higher
failure
rates
but
this
pattern
differed
throughout
the
nesting
season
.

Nest
site
characteristics
including
nest
height
and
degree
of
nest
concealment
did
not
influence
Hooded
Warbler
nest
survival
rates
.

to

in
the

.

In

which

.

Results
suggest
that
the
presence
of
regenerating
clearcuts
did
not
influence
density
or
nesting
success
of
Cerulean
Warblers
in
adjacent
mature

.

Instead
,
local
habitat
features
explained
variation
in
warbler
density
and
daily

better
than
landscape

scale
characteristics
.

Density
and
nesting
success
were
positively
associated
with
canopy

,
numbers
of

,
and
number
of
grapevines
all
of
which
are
typical

.

Consequently
,
our
study
provides
evidence
that
improved

require
creating

Ornamental

Thus
,
the

among

species
presents
something
of
a
conundrum

Under
certain

can
increase

We
addressed
this
possibility
in
the
mountain
bluebird
,
a
socially
monogamous
songbird
in
which
males
possess
brilliant
ultravioletblue
plumage
.

In
pairwise
comparisons
,
males
that
sired
extra
-
pair
offspring
were
not
more
colorful
than
the
males
that
they
cuckolded
.

However
,
males
that
sired
at
least
one
extra
-
pair
offspring
were
,
on
average
,
brighter
and
more
ultraviolet
-
blue
than
males
that
did
not
sire
extra
-
pair
offspring
.

More
-
colorful
males
sired
more
offspring
both
with
their
own
mate
and
with
extra
-
pair
mates
,
and
thus
sired
more
offspring
overall
.

These
results
support
the
hypothesis
that
the
brilliant
UV
-
blue
ornamental
plumage
of
male
mountain
bluebirds
evolved
at
least
in
part
because
it
provides
males
with
an
advantage
in
fertilizing
the
eggs
of
multiple

GENETICALLY

BASED
MORPHOLOGICAL
DIFFERENTIATION
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
DIVERGENT
NEUTRAL
MARKERS
IN
SUBSPECIES
OF
THE
SWAMP

A
COMMON
GARDEN
EXPERIMENT

The
Coastal
Plain
Swamp
Sparrow
(
Melospiza
georgiana
nigrescens
)
differs
morphologically
from
conspecific
populations
in
ways
that
are
similar
to
other
tidal
marsh
subspecies
.

However
,
Swamp
Sparrows
show
no
genetic
structure
in
neutral
markers
.

Many
areas
of
tidal
marsh
are
recent
,
post
-
glacial
formations
.

However
,
in
addition
to
being
ephemeral
in
evolutionary
time
,
tidal
marshes
present
a
profoundly
divergent
environment
.

Therefore
,
selection
may
have
shaped
adaptive
differences
even
when
colonization
of
a
habitat
is
recent
.

Alternatively
,
local
morphological
differences
may
be
the
result
of
phenotypic
plasticity
.

We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
morphological
divergence
between
tidal
marsh
and
inland
populations
of
Swamp
Sparrow
is
the
result
of
genetic
differences
using
a
common
garden
experiment
.

We
found
that
morphological
differences
present
in
wild
populations
of
coastal
and
inland
swamp
sparrows
are
maintained
in
lab
-
reared
populations
.

These
results
support
the
hypothesis
that
morphological
differences
between
populations
are
genetically
based
and
suggest
that
natural
selection
is
driving
morphological
divergence
.

A
subspecies
definition
based
primarily
on
patterns
of
divergence
in
neutral
markers
would
miss
the
phenomenon
of
the
evolution
of
adaptive
traits
in
recently
established
populations
.

OF

JUVENILE
POST

FLEDGING
SURVIVAL
OF
GRAY
CATBIRDS
,
IN
A
SUBURBAN
WORLD

The
dynamics
of
the
post
-
fledging
period
is
a
poorly
understood
stage
for
passerine
birds
and
has
rarely
been
studied
in
urban
habitats
.

One
factor
that
may
reduce
the
success
of
breeding
birds
in
these
habitats
are
free
-
ranging
cats
.

In
2004
,
we
quantified
nest
success
and
post
-
fledging
survivorship
of
Gray
catbirds
(
Dumatella
carolinensis
)
using
radio
telemetry
at
three
suburban
sites
,
Bethesda(B
Spring
Park(SP
)
and
Opal
Daniels(OD
in
the
greater
area
Washington
,
DC
region
that
also
varied
in
cat
density
.

Nest
success
varied
from
0.853
at
B
to
0.426
and
0.500
at
SP
and
OD
Park
.

Post
-
fledgling
survival
to
nine
weeks
for
B
,
SP
,
and
OD
Park
was
0.41
,
0.22
,
and
0.08
.

Overall
survival
rate
from
incubation
through
9
wks
post
-
fledging
was
0.35

(
B
0.09
(
SP
)
and
0.042
(
OD
On
multiple
occasions
fledglings
were
seen
being
killed
by
cats
or
found
beheaded
,
which
is
consistent
with
a
cat
predation
event
.

Understanding
the
effect
of
increasing
urbanization
on
birds
,
and
the
subsequent
increased
exposure
to
factors
associated
with
human
population
pressure
,
such
as
domestic
cats
,
is
critical
for
informed
conservation
decisions
.

RECENT
PALILA
POPULATION
DECLINE

RELATIVE
TO
HABITAT
STRUCTURE
AND
BROWSING
THREATS

The
endangered
Palila
(
Loxioides
bailleui
)
is
primarily
restricted
to
30
km2
of
subalpine
woodland
on
Mauna
Kea
Volcano
,
Hawaii
.

Palila
range
above
elevations
where
introduced
diseases
have
decimated
many
other
Hawaiian
forest
bird
populations
,
but
Palila
are
threatened
by
introduced
ungulates
,
predators
,
and
food
competitors
.

Dependence
on
mamane
(
Sophora
chrysophylla
)
seeds
for
food
makes
Palila
highly
vulnerable
to
the
impacts
of
browsing
ungulates
,
which
have
degraded
Hawaiian
forests
for
over
200
years
.

Since
2003
the
Palila
population
has
steadily
and
significantly
declined
64
%
to
2,237
.

We
detected
Palila
more
frequently
at
sites
with
numerous
,
tall
mamane
,
and
we
found
nests
more
often
in
trees
that
were
>
4-m
-
tall
and
>
25-years
-
old
.

Vegetation
surveys
revealed
that
the
mean
height
of
mature
2
m
)
mamane
trees
was
3.7
m
and
that
61
%
of
trees
were
<
4-m
-
tall
,
signifying
that
most
mamane
trees
on
Mauna
Kea
sprouted
after
thinning
of
ungulate
populations
began
in
1980
.

We
detected
ungulate
damage
to
trees
in
219/479
(
46
of
plots
,
suggesting
that
continued
and
widespread
ungulate
impacts
could
be
slowing
forest
and
palila
recovery
.

IN
AN

(
SAO
TOME
)

ENDEMIC
PASSERINE
(
SPEIROPS
LUGUBRIS
)

Adaptation
of
communication
systems
to
local
environments
predicts
that
when
environments
differ
ecologically
,
divergences
in
communication
systems
will
occur
.

This
,
in
turn
,
may
lead
to
the
evolution
of
pre
-
mating
barriers
,
which
have
been
thought
to
be
one
of
the
most
important
mechanisms
in
reproductive
isolation
.

Global
anthropogenic
environmental
change
is
therefore
expected
to
affect
signal
evolution
.

We
examine
the
effects
of
recent
anthropogenic
change
in
the
divergence
of
some
phenotypic
patterns
of
Speirops
lugubris
,
an
endemic
passerine
of
Sao
Tome
Island
.

Data
on
plugame
colorimetrics
,
song
and
morphology
were
collected
from
individuals
on
both
primary
forest
and
shade
forest
plantations
,
a
habitat
less
than
200
years
-
old
.

Results
showed
no
plumage
color
differences
between
habitats
,
however
those
in
shade
forest
plantations
were
significantly
smaller
than
birds
in
undisturbed
forest
.

Song
diversity
was
high
,
with
very
few
song
types
shared
between
individuals
.

Nevertheless
,
the
physical
properties
of
the
songs
related
to
vegetation
structure
characteristics
that
differed
between
habitats
.

This
observed
change
in
a
small
island
population
suggests
that
mate
recognition
signals
,
a
fundamental
trait
for
fitness
,
are
able
to
respond
quickly
to
habitat
changes
.

THE
ISTHMUS
OF
TEHUANTEPEC
AS
A
VICARIANT
BARRIER
:

A
TEST
OF
SIMULTANEOUS
DIVERSIFICATION
IN
MONTANE
FOREST
BIRDS
.

A
common
yet
elusive
goal
in
historical
biogeography
and
comparative
phylogeography
is
determining
if
codistributed
taxa
have
experienced
simultaneous
diversification
due
to
a
common
barrier
.

Estimates
of
the
timing
of
vicariant
events
can
be
obtained
by
applying
a
calibrated
molecular
clock
to
phylogenies
.

However
,
there
are
large
variances
on
these
estimates
due
to
the
stochastic
nature
of
the
gene
coalescent
,
differences
in
effective
populations
size
,
etc
.

The
use
of
multiple
independently
assorting
molecular
markers
should
reduce
the
variance
around
these
estimates
.

We
employed
multiple
loci
(
nuclear
introns
and
mitochondrial
sequence
data
)
to
test
the
hypothesis
of
simultaneous
intraspecific
diversification
in
montane
forest
birds
that
occur
on
both
sides
of
the
Isthmus
of
Tehuantepec
.

This
study
provides
an
empirical
test
of
the
ability
of
multiple
loci
to
reject
the
hypothesis
of
simultaneous
vicariance
of
codistributed
bird
species
as
well
as
illuminate
the
biogeographic
history
of
the
area
.

Mitochondrial
data
suggest
taxa
have
not
experienced
simultaneous
diversification
,
but
as
predicted
the
variance
around
these
estimate
is
large
.

Analyses
employing
intron
data
improves
the
estimates
of
divergence
times
and
corroborates
the
mitochondrial
results
.

FLUORESCENCE
AND
SEXUAL
DICHROMATISM
IN
THE
BLUE
-
WINGED
PARROTLET
Birds
are
known
to
be
able
to
perceive
both
visible
and
UV
wavelength
radiation
.

Therefore
,
objective
studies
of
spectral
reflectance
independent
of
human
perception
became
popular
to
approach
sexual
dichromatism
.

However
,
fluorescence
properties
of
feathers
have
been
much
less
studied
.

Fluorescence
occurs
when
short
wavelength
radiation
is
absorbed
and
re
-
emitted
as
longer
wavelength
radiation
.

We
studied
the
plumage
coloration
of
the
Blue
-
Winged
Parrotlet
em
>

Forpus
xanthopterygius</em
describing
its
reflectance
and
fluorescence
properties
and
found
sexual
differences
in
both
.

Maximum
fluorescence
emission
was
obtained
when
the
plumage
was
excited
with
UV
wavelengths
,
and
its
intensity
was
higher
in
the
visible
range
,
close
to
the
wavelengths
of
maximum
total
reflectance
.

Intensity
of
fluorescence
was
higher
for
males
than
for
females
.

The
shapes
of
total
reflectance
and
reflectance
without
the
fluorescent
component
differed
significantly
,
and
the
presumption
that
this
difference
is
due
to
the
influence
of
fluorescence
is
supported
by
the
shape
of
the
fluorescence
spectrum
.

These
results
suggest
that
the
fluorescent
component
is
significant
to
total
color
signal
and
might
act
as
an
enhancer
of
sexual
dichromatism
in
this
species
.

DOES
MILITARY

Despite
the
large
amount
of
anthropogenic
disturbance
occurring
on
military
bases
,
they
provide
suitable
habitat
for
a
wide
variety
of
breeding
birds
.

Unfortunately
,
the
direct
effects
of
military
maneuvers
on
passerine
breeding
behavior
have
received
relatively
little
attention
.

It
is
feasible
that
these
training
activities
inhibit
the
parental
care
and
overall
productivity
of
birds
inhabiting
these
bases
.

In
this
study
I
am
investigating
the
effects
of
military
activity
on
the
reproductive
behavior
of
Northern
Cardinals
em
>

Cardinalis
cardinalis</em

I
am
comparing
the
behaviors
of
birds
inhabiting
sites
with
relatively
high
and
low
levels
of
military
training
at
Fort
Hood
,
TX
,
the
nation
's
largest
military
installation
.

The
primary
behaviors
of
interest
are
nest
defense
and
nestling
provisioning
,
as
alterations
of
these
two
aspects
of
parental
care
could
have
substantial
negative
impacts
on
reproductive
success
.

I
am
also
comparing
nestling
growth
rates
,
hormonal
responses
,
and
nest
success
between
sites
.

Knowledge
gained
from
this
project
will
help
ensure
the
appropriate
management
of
avian
populations
on
military

AN
EXAMPLE
USING
AGRICULTURAL
IMPACTS
ON
CANADIAN
PRAIRIE
WETLANDS
,
1985
-
2005
.

Canadian
prairie
wetlands
are
important
breeding
areas
for
many
North
American
bird
species
,
and
evidence
suggests
that
over
half
of
the
region
's
wetlands
have
been
lost
,
primarily
to
agriculture
.

Yet
,
there
is
little
information
about
degradations
occurring
to
remaining
wetlands
and
their
potential
effects
on
bird
populations
.

Attempts
to
estimate
wetland
impact
rates
are
complicated
by
wetlands
'
potential
resilience
and
ability
to
recover
from
impacts
given
time
and/or
restoration
efforts
.

We
used
multistate
models
in
Program
MARK
to
estimate
wetland
impact
and
recovery
rates
from
wetland
data
collected
during
annual
Waterfowl
Breeding
Population
and
Habitat
Surveys
(
1985
-
2005

We
considered
that
rates
may
covary
by
province
and
ecoregion
,
precipitation
,
surrounding
land
use
,
and
wetland
permanence
.

Results
indicate
that
impact
and
recovery
rates
for
wetland
margins
declined
over
time
,
and
examination
of
incidence
of
margin
degradations
revealed
the
decline
in
rates
could
be
attributed
to
a
decreasing
percentage
of
unaffected
wetlands
.

Results
also
demonstrate
that
wetland
permanence
and
adjacent
land
uses
affect
wetland
impact
and
recovery
rates
.

Implications
for
bird
species
that
depend
on
this
highly
degraded
habitat
will
be
considered
.

IMPLICATIONS
FOR
THE
EVOLUTION

We
isolated
what
we
believe
to
be
uncontaminated
DNA
from
eggshells
in
a
buried
offering
(
dated
to
cal
.

AD

at
the
NSF
University
of
Arizona
AMS
facility
)
from
the
prehispanic
site
of
El
Palmillo
in
Oaxaca
,
Mexico
.

We
obtained
several
different
sequences
of
mitochondrial
cytochrome
b
and
ND3
genes
from
the
eggshell
fragments
suggesting
that
several
species
were
represented
.

Comparisons
with
GenBank
sequences
and
those
of
colleagues
identify
some
of
these
fragments
as
Hermit
Thrush
(
Catharus
guttatus
Others
are
avian
,
but
we
have
been
unable
to
determine
the
species
.

Based
on
eggshell
thickness
they
appear
to
be
from
a
large
bird
.

Because
we
believe
that
the
sequences
do
not
represent
contamination
,
we
also
discuss
the
implications
of
these

Today

thus
these

We
examined
the
genetic
relationships
among
21
populations
of
Northern
Goshawks
em
>

Accipiter
gentilis</em
from
across
a
large
portion
of
their
Nearctic
range
.

We
used
mitochondrial
control
region
sequences
from
315
goshawks
to
address
questions
concerning
historical
isolation
into
Pleistocene
forest
refugia
and
post
-
glacial
gene
flow
,
and
whether
genetic
data
corroborated
clinal
variation
in
size
morphology
and
identifed
unique
population
segments
.

Results
indicated
goshawks
were
historically
isolated
into
at
least
three
glacial
period
populations
(
Pacific
Coastal
,
Southwestern
and
Eastern
and
subsequently
experienced
post
-
glacial
range
expansion
,
which
has
resulted
in
two
unique
zones
of
admixture
among
Intermountian
Western
populations
.

Goshawks
were
subdivided
into
five
major
geographic
regions
based
on
genetic
differences
:
California
,
Colorado
Plateau
,
Arizona
Sky
Islands
,
New
Mexico
and
a
large
group
including
the
Rocky
Mountains
,
Great
lakes
and
Central
Appalachian
Mountains
.

Gene
flow
among
these
geographic
regions
was
directionally
asymmetrical
and
more
limited
in
the
Southwest
and
California
.

The
geographic
distribution
of
major
haplogroups
agreed
with
clinal

IMPACTS
OF
CHRONIC
ANTHROPOGENIC
NOISE
FROM
ENERGY
-
SECTOR
ACTIVITY

ON
BOREAL
SONGBIRDS

Numerous
studies
have
demonstrated
reduced
bird
densities
near
roads
.

Noise
from
traffic
is
often
assumed
to
be
the
cause
of
this
reduction
.

However
,
confounding
factors
make
it
difficult
to
demonstrate
that
noise
per
se
is
the
causal
factor
reducing
bird
use
of
road
-
habitat
edges
.

By
comparing
bird
abundance
close
to
versus
far
from
noise
-
generating
and
noiseless
energy
facilities
in
the
boreal
forest
of
Alberta
,
Canada
we
were
able
to
study
the
effects
of
noise
on
passerines
while
removing
the
confounding
effects
of
traffic
and
edge
effects
.

By
statistically
correcting
for
detection
error
via
distance
sampling
to
estimate
density
and
repeat
-
sampling
to
estimate
occupancy
,
we
found
a
34
%
reduction
in
total
passerine
density
near
noisy
energy
facilities
relative
to
noiseless
facilities
.

Of
the
23
species
modelled
,
48
%
had
significantly
lower
density
and/or
occupancy
rate
near
noise
-
generating
facilities
.

The
mechanisms
causing
reduced
abundance
in
noisy
areas
will
be
discussed
using
the
Ovenbird
as
a
model
species
.

USE

DETERENTS

TO
REDUCE
THE
MORTALITY
OF
OSPREYS
AT
FISH
FARMS
IN
CENTRAL
AND
SOUTH
AMERICA
Wintering
Ospreys

are
attracted
to
fish
farms
throughout
Central
and
South
America
.

We
conducted
a
survey
to
estimate
the
numbers
of
Osprey
and
other
fish
-
eating
birds
killed
at
these
fish
farms
annually
.

We
surveyed
252
fish
farms
in
eight
countries
.

Twenty
-
two
species
of
birds
,
including
cormorants
,
kingfishers
,
egrets
,
herons
,
kiskadees
,
and
Ospreys
were
reported
by
fish
farms
to
be
problem
birds
that
took
fish
from
ponds
.

Fish
farm
managers
tried
a
variety
of
devices
to
reduce
their
losses
to
birds
but
most
used
shooting
and
trapping
.

Estimates
of
birds
shot
ranged
from
hundreds
in
Brazil
,
Ecuador
,
and
Guatemala
to
thousands
in
Colombia
.

We
tested
three
bird
deterent
devices
at
three
fish
farms
to
determine
their
effectiveness
in
reducing
losses
of
fish
to
birds
.

Overhead
lines
proved
most
effective
on
Ospreys
while
wire
fencing
around
ponds
was
most
effective
on
wading
birds
like
herons
and
egrets
.

Our
results
indicate
a
combination
of
overhead
lines
and
perimeter
fencing
will
significantly
reduce
use
of
fish
farms
by
problem
birds
and
reduce
mortality
caused
by
shooting

THE
INFLUENCE
OF
SEX
,
AGE
,
AND
ORNAMENTATION

ON
EXPERIMENTALLY
INCREASED
REPRODUCTIVE
EFFORT
IN
PROTHONOTARY

Many
species
are
faced
with
a
trade
-
off
between
investment
in
current
versus
future
reproductive
success
.

The
level
of
investment
in
a
given
reproductive
event
could
be
influenced
by
an
individual
's
sex
or
age
or
the
quality
of
its
mate
.

We
examined
the
influence
of
these
factors
on
reproductive
investment
in
Prothonotary
warblers
by
comparing
experimental
pairs
(
broods
increased
by
2
offspring
)
to
control
pairs
(
raising
unmanipulated
broods
We
first
determined
if
the
manipulation
created
stressful
rearing
conditions
for
nestlings
by
measuring
aspects
of
nestling
growth
and
concentrations
of
corticosterone
.

Compared
to
control
broods
,
the
growth
of
nestlings
in
increased
broods
was
impaired
,
but
they
did
not
differ
in
corticosterone
concentrations
.

We
measured
provisioning
rates
and
found
that
the
mate
's
plumage
ornamentation
did
not
influence
the
provisioning
rate
of
its
partner
.

We
found
that
males
paired
to
young
females
fed
nestlings
at
a
higher
rate
regardless
of
brood
type
,
suggesting
that
young
females
may
require
more
male
help
than
older
females
.

Further
analyses
will
indicate
if
plumage
color
is
in
fact
a
condition
-
dependent
trait
in
this
species
.

AVIAN
ABUNDANCE
AND
DIVERSITY
IN
TREATMENT
WETLANDS
IN
SOUTH
FLORIDA

Over
12,950
ha
of
wetlands
,
have
been
constructed
on
former
agricultural
lands
in
South
Florida
since
1994
.

These
constructed
wetlands
,
referred
to
as
Stormwater
Treatment
Areas
(
STAs
use
a
combination
of
emergent
and
submergent
aquatic
vegetation
treatments
to
remove
excess
phosphorous
from
agricultural
and
residential
runoff
water
.

Although
not
the
intended
purpose
of
STAs
,
these
constructed
wetlands
may
serve
as
important
habitat
for
birds
,
particularly
if
the
elevated
nutrient
levels
in
STAs
,
cascade
through
the
food
web
.

We
used
point
counts
arranged
in
a
stratified
sampling
design
to
quantify
bird
abundance
and
diversity
in
two
habitat
types
common
to
each
STA
,
open
water
with
submergent
aquatic
vegetation
and
dense
emergent
vegetation
with
intermittent
open
water
.

We
also
sampled
aquatic
fauna
at
random
sites
using
a
1-m2
throw
trap
and
recorded
water
depth
from
gauges
in
each
STA
.

Bird
abundance
(
P
0.001
)
and
diversity
(
P
0.008
)
were
higher
in
the
submerged
vegetation
habitat
than
the
emergent
habitat
.

Bird
diversity
also
differed
among
STAs
(
P
0.001

Neither
aquatic
fauna
density
nor
water
depth
significantly
affected
avian
abundance
or
diversity

BEHAVIOURAL
RESPONSES
OF
AUSTRALIAN
RAPTORS

TO
A
NOVEL
FOOD
SOURCE
:

THE
INVASIVE
TOXIC
CANE
TOAD
.

Invasive
species
can
lead
to
dramatic
loss
of
native
species
and
ecosystem
change
,
and
have
been
ranked
as
the
third
greatest
threat
to
bird
populations
globally
.

In
some
cases
,
however
,
the
arrival
of
an
invasive
species
may
have
positive
not
negative
impacts
on
some
component
of
the
native
ecosystem
:
for
example
,
the
invader
may
provide
a
new
food
resource
for
predators
or
scavengers
.

The
cane
toad
em

Bufo
marinus</em
is
one
of
the
world
's
most
infamous
invasive
species
,
and
has
adversely
affected
populations
of
many
of
Australia
's
native
predators
(
snakes
,
lizards
,
quolls
Remarkably
,
studies
on
the
ecological
impact
of
cane
toads
largely
have
ignored
birds
and
scavengers
.

We
investigated
behavioral
responses
of
native
Australian
avian
scavengers
to
this
novel
and
toxic
food
source
.

We
presented
free
-
ranging
avian
scavengers
with
roadkilled
cane
toads
and
frogs
,
and
monitored
offtake
rates
and
preferences
.

Overall
,
raptors
exploit
this
novel
food
source
to
provide
significant
additional
resources
,
but
(
presumably
reflecting
their
powerful
toxins
toads
are
less
preferred
than
native
frogs
if
a
choice
is
available
.

ISLAND

WHISPER
SONG
DIVERGENCE
IN
A
SPECIES
OF
HAWAIIAN
HONEYCREEPER

,
THE
'
AMAKIHI
The
Hawaiian
Islands
provide
a
perfect
setting
to
study
adaptive
radiation
because
of
its
geographic
isolation
from
the
mainland
.

Every
million
years
,
a
new
Hawaiian
island
emerges
as
the
result
of
volcanic
activity
and
the
northwest
movement
of
the
Pacific
plate
.

As
a
result
,
the
'
amakihi
colonizing
each
new
island
have
diverged
from
their
parent
species
,
resulting
in
increased
species
diversity
across
the
island
chain
.

The
question
remains
whether
isolated
colonization
has
created
variations
in
'
amakihi
vocalization
and
if
so
,
what
trends
among
the
islands
can
be
identified
?

We
examined
the
structure
of
adult
'
amakihi
whisper
song
using
spectrographic
cross
-
correlation
analysis
,
which
revealed
complex
song
and
syllable
structures
within
and
across
island
groups
.

Preliminary
data
suggests
that
'
amakihi
syllable
sharing
is
higher
within
the
island
of
Kauai
than
within
Hawaii
(
9.9
%

2.4
When
intra

island
songs
are
compared
,
Kauai
and

.

This
suggests
a
divergence
between
Hawaii
'
amakihi
song
and
other
island
species
,
and
whisper
songs
of
Kauai
and
Maui
'

are
more

GROUSE

As
with
most
technologies
,
GPS
tracking
of
birds
can
be
advantageous
for
a
variety
of
studies
.

However
,
there
can
be
challenges
to
overcome
,
depending
on
the
species
being
studied
.

We
report
on
the
successes
and
challenges
of
GPS
tracking
Greater
Sage
Grouse
(
both
male
and
female
)
and
a
breeding
pair
of
Common
Ravens
and
their
offspring
through
three
years
.

We
found
that
home
range
estimates
using
VHF
telemetry
tracking
can
greatly
underestimate
the
true
home
range
when
using
minimum
convex
polygon
estimates
and
overestimate
when
using
kernel
estimators
when
compared
with
complete
GPS
datasets
.

We
discuss
the
advantages
of
GPS
tracking
to
describe
daily
movements
,
roost
analysis
,
interand
intra
-
specific
interactions
,
and
implications
for
habitat
analyses
and
foraging
studies
.

We
will
also
discuss
challenges
in
attachment
techniques
,
fix
rate
success
in
a
variety
of
scenarios
,
and
general
appropriateness
of
using
GPS
transmitters
in
avian
studies
.

ANTHROPGENIC
INFLUENCES
ON
COMMON
RAVEN
DEMOGRAPHICS
IN
THE
GREATER
YELLOWSTONE
ECOSYSTEM
.

Common
Raven
lt;em&gt;Corvus
corax&lt;/em&gt
populations
have
been
increasing
across
the
western
US
over
the
past
few
decades
.

Such
is
the
case
for
the
strictly
protected
areas
in
southern
portion
of
the
Greater
Yellowstone
Ecosystem
.

Using
a
60-yr
dataset
,
we
have
found
that
Common
Raven
nesting
densities
have
increased
greater
than
200
%
over
the
past
six
decades
in
Grand
Teton
National
Park
(
the
Park
resulting
in
one
of
the
densest
breeding
populations
recorded
.

Further
,
using
detailed
demography
data
collected
from
2002
-
2008
,
we
have
found
that
the
nesting
density
of
ravens
in
the
town
of
Jackson
,
WY
(
on
the
southern
edge
of
the
Park
)
to
be
nearly
ten
times
that
of
the
Park
(
0.19
and
2.0
pairs
/
km2
,
respectively
We
found
significantly
higher
productivity
rates
and
earlier
nest
initiations
in
town
and
will
report
on
post
-
fledging
survival
rates
in
the
two
areas
.

We
have
also
documented
natal
dispersal
records
indicating
that
town
is
potentially
attracting
ravens
fledged
in
the
Park
.

DIFFERENT
SONG
-
LEARNING
STRATEGIES
IN
EASTERN
AND
WESTERN
SONG

Eastern
and
western
song
sparrows
show
some
notable
differences
in
their
song
repertoires
and
perhaps
in
their
singing
behavior
as
well
.

The
first
major
difference
observed
was
that
neighboring
song
sparrows
in
western
populations
share
song
types
whereas
those
in
eastern
populations
do
not
.

Some
investigators
have
speculated
that
this
population
difference
reflects
a
fundamental
difference
in
the
song
learning
strategies
of
birds
in
the
two
populations
.

The
alternative
hypothesis
is
that
the
difference
is
a
proximate
effect
of
demographic
differences
between
western
and
eastern
populations
.

Most
of
the
western
populations
studied
to
date
are
sedentary
whereas
most
of
the
eastern
populations
studied
are
migratory
,
and
this
difference
,
combined
with
other
demographic
differences
,
may
mean
that
the
birds
encountered
early
,
during
the
learning
phase
,
and
those
encountered
late
,
during
territory
establishment
,
are
generally
the
same
in
western
population
but
are
typically
different
in
eastern
populations
.

I
will
discuss
the
present
evidence
for
and
against
these
competing
hypotheses
and
suggest
future
approaches
to
the
issue
.

RESOURCE
SELECTION
OF
TWO
WADING
BIRD
SPECIES
WITH
DIVERGENT
FORAGING
STRATEGIES
Seasonal
variation
in
food
availability
is
particularly
pronounced
in
wetlands
,
ecosystems
which
dry
and
flood
periodically
.

In
the
Everglades
,
wading
birds
depend
on
the
process
of
the
seasonal
drying
to
concentrate
fauna
in
patches
.

Identifying
the
key
habitat
characteristics
of
those
patches
for
species
with
contrasting
foraging
strategies
will
provide
a
target
range
of
habitat
conditions
for
the
Everglades
restoration
.

We
quantified
the
habitat
selection
of
radio
-
tagged
Great
Egrets
em
>
Ardea
alba</em
and
White
Ibises

Eudocimus
albus</em
two
species
that
are
representative
of
different
foraging
strategies
(
searchers
versus
exploiters
and
that
have
dissimilar
population
trends
.

Habitat
variables
at
foraging
locations
were
measured
and
compared
with
habitat
variables
at
random
locations
.

We
calculated
resource
selection
functions
using
a
discrete
choice
proportional
hazards
model
that
allows
available
resource
units
to
change
daily
.

A
preliminary
analysis
showed
that
both
species
preferred

intermediate

,
intermediate

and
an
increased
number
of
days
since
a

was
last
dry
.

Great
Egrets
additionally
selected
foraging
sites
with
a
high
water
recession
rate
.

These
parameters
are
conducive
to
both
enhance
and
concentrate
prey
populations

NESTING
BEHAVIOR
OF

THE
'
AKIKIKI
OR
KAUA'I
CREEPER
The
'
Akikiki
,
also
known
as
the
Kaua’i
Creeper
em
>

Oreomystic
bairdi</em
is
one
of
the
United
States
'
most
poorly
known
birds
.

The
species
was
first
described
in
1887
,
but
it
has
never
been
the
sole
focus
of
any
research
program
and
its
most
basic
life
history
details
remain
undescribed
.

This
single
-
island
endemic
's
small
population
size
,
estimated
at
less
than
1500
individuals
,
and
its
drastic
decline
since
1970
underscore
an
acute
need
for
life
-
history
data
of
any
type
.

We
describe
the
behavior
of
nesting
'
Akikiki
observed
during
2007
and
2008
in
the
Alaka'i
Wilderness
Preserve
on
Kaua'i
,
including
the
first
observations
of
a
nest
attended
by
a
color
-
banded
pair
.

Time
budget
and
pair
interaction
data
suggest
that
male
'
Akikiki
exhibit
high
energetic
investment
during
nesting
.

This
was
supported
by
frequent
courtship
feeding
of
the
incubating
female
,
which
was
often
followed
by
both
birds
leaving
the
nest
area
to
forage
together
.

These
data
provide
insight
into
the
breeding
ecology
and
pair
dynamics
of
this
imperiled
Hawaiian
honeycreeper
and
may
inform
management
actions
to
ensure
the
'
Akikiki
's
persistence
in
the
native
rainforest
of
Kaua'i

BIRD
SPECIES
DIVERSITY
AND
RESOURCE
AVAILABILITY

WITHIN
A
TALLGRASS
PRAIRIE
UNDERGOING
RESTORATION
.

Thirty
-
one
point
census
counts
in
two
areas
undergoing
prairie
restoration
and
one
control
were
conducted
on
breeding
birds
during
the
summer
of
2007
.

Data
were
supplemented
by
banding
in
the
same
areas
.

The
three
areas
were
:
New
Prairie
(
2
years
of
restoration
Old
Prairie
(
10
years
and
Old
Field

(
no
restoration
Results
indicated
that
the
Old
Prairie
had
significantly
greater
bird
species
diversity
,
with
both
more
species
and
higher
abundances
in
comparison
to
the
New
Prairie
and
Old
Field
.

The
New
Prairie
had
a
lower
bird
species
diversity
than
the
Old
Field
,
but
had
more
species
and
higher
abundances
per
species
.

These
findings
corresponded
with
a
greater
diversity
of
native
vegetation
in
the
prairie
areas
,
while
the
Old
Field
was
entirely
composed
of
weeds
.

There
were
no
correlations
of
bird
species
diversity
with
insect
diversity
for
this
study
,
contrary
to
earlier
findings
.

These
results
suggest
that
tallgrass
prairies
at
earlier
and
later
stages
of
restoration
are
more
successful
in
providing
resources
for
birds
than
weedy
fields
.

METAPOPULATION
DYNAMICS
OF
BLACK
AND
VIRGINIA
RAILS
:

USING
OCCUPANCY
MODELS

TO
EVALUATE

THE
ROLES
OF
BIOGEOGRAPHY
,
HABITAT
,
AND
REGIONAL
FACTORS
.

How
extinction
and
colonization
rates
are
influenced
by
habitat
quality
and
regional
factors
relative
to
classical
biogeographic
factors
is
not
well
understood
in
real
metapopulations
.

Moreover
,
past
studies
rarely
accounted
for
imperfect
detection
when
estimating
turnover
.

We
use
multiple
-
season
occupancy
models
to
examine
correlates
of
extinction
and
colonization
in
metapopulations
of
Black
(
BLRA
)
and
Virginia
(
VIRA
)

Rails
inhabiting
small
wetlands
in
the
Sierra
foothills
.

We
conducted
playback
surveys
from
2002
-
2007
at
202
sites
.

Detection
modeling
suggested
little
effect
of
visit
covariates
for
BLRA
,
although
year
and
visit
number
influenced
VIRA
detections
.

Site
-
specific
detection
was
0.99
for
BLRA
and
0.61
-
0.98
for
VIRA
.

Turnover
occurred
frequently
,
differed
little
among
years
,
and
was
balanced
until
an
extinction
event
in
2007
.

However
,
both
extinction
(
0.25
vs.
0.19
)
and
colonization
(
0.28
vs.
0.16
)
were
higher
for
VIRA
than
BLRA
.

Biogeographic
factors
had
a
greater
influence
on
turnover
than
matrix
characteristics
,
land
use
,
and
hydrology
for
both
species
.

Extinction
was
negatively
related
to
area
,
however
,
patch
isolation
exerted
the
most
influence
on
both
extinction
and
colonization
in
BLRAs
,
suggesting
an
important
role
of
rescue
effects
.

REDUNDANCY
ACROSS
MODALITIES
:
COLOR
AND
SONG
IN
CHESTNUT
-
SIDED
WARBLERS

Why
do
so
many
songbirds
invest
in
multiple
,
multi
-
modal
,
sexually
selected
traits
such
as
colorful
plumage
and
elaborate
song
?

One
hypothesis
that
explains
the
evolution
of
multiple
,
multi
-
modal
,

sexually
selected
traits
is
the
Redundant
Signals
hypothesis
,
which
states
that
multiple
traits
broadcast
overlapping
information
,
either
to
amplify
the
signal
,
or
to
compensate
for
unreliable
signals
.

I
tested
the
redundant
signals
hypothesis
by
assessing
multiple
visual
and
acoustic
traits
in
a
colorful
migratory
songbird
,
the
chestnutsided
warbler
em
>

Dendroica
pensylvanica</em
For
each
warbler
,
I
measured
the
area
of
three
plumage
patches
:
chestnut
stripes
,
black
facial
masks
,
and
yellow
caps
and
the
spectral
qualities
of
chestnut
stripes
and
yellow
caps
.

I
also
measured
frequency
and
timing
performance
parameters
for
each
of
the
two
categories
of
songs
sung
by
each
male
.

In
addition
,
I
assessed
female
preferences
for
these
color
and
song
traits
using
genetic
analysis
of
paternity
to
determine
color
and
song
traits
of
social
and
extrapair
mates
.

I
found
a
pattern
of
correlations
among
traits
both
within
visual
and
acoustic
modalities
and
between
these
modalities
.

Several
measurements
of
plumage
patch
area
,
brightness
,
and
hue
were
correlated
with
each
other
and
with
singing
performance
.

Altogether
,
these
results
provide
firm
evidence
for
redundancy
across
modalities
of
multiple
sexually
selected
traits
in
chestnut
-
sided
warblers
.

LEARNING
TO
CHOOSE
AMONG
SOCIAL
FORAGING
STRATEGIES
IN
ADULT
HOUSE
SPARROWS
.

Research
on
the
producer
-
scrounger
game
has
mainly
focused
on
the
different
factors
influencing
its
ESS
solution
,
but
very
little
is
known
on
the
mechanisms
that
shape
players
'
decisions
.

A
recent
experimental
study
has
shown
that
early
experience
can
affect
producer
-
scrounger
foraging
tendencies
in
young
house
sparrows
,
but
whether
such
learning
continues
through
adulthood
was
not
clear
.

Here
we
show
that
manipulating
the
success
rate
experienced
by
adult
sparrows
when
following
others
on
one
day
can
change
their
strategy
choice
in
the
next
day
.

To
manipulate
joining
success
we
used
stuffed
adult
house
sparrows
that
were
positioned
on
a
foraging
gird
.

We
created
two
reward
regimes
:
a
positive
one
,
in
which
the
stuffed
models
were
placed
near
food
,
and
a
negative
one
,
in
which
the
models
were
placed
away
from
food
.

Our
results
show
a
strong
and
significant
increase
in
joining
behaviour
after
the
positive
treatment
,
but
no
change
after
the
negative
treatment
.

These
results
show
for
the
first
time
that
adult
birds
can
monitor
their
success
and
learn
to
choose
among
social
foraging
strategies
in
the
producer
-
scrounger
game

is
a
major
cause
of
nest

,
yet
few
studies
consider
the
impacts
of

Because
nests
are
vulnerable
to
multiple
predator
species
,
analyses
of
temporal

habitat
,

factors
that
pool
all

Risk
of
rat

predation
was
greater
during
the
nestling

,
whereas
cowbirds
were
more
likely
to
remove
eggs
.

Additionally
,
risk
of
predation
by
cowbirds
and
raptors
decreased
throughout
the
breeding
season
,
while
rat
snake
predation
risk
increased
.

Although
habitat
features
and
proximity
to
different
edge
types
were
important
predictors
of
the
probability
of
predation
attempts
by
all
three
groups
,
none
emerged
as
consistent
predictors
for
all
predator

These

Two
hypotheses
currently
address
variation
in
nest
size
in
cavity
nesting
birds
.

The
"
sexual
selection
"
hypothesis
suggests
that
nest
size
reflects
the
health
status
/
quality
of
the
builder
;

the
"
thermoregulatory
"
hypothesis
suggests
that
females
adjust
nest
size
to
maintain
egg
temperatures
and
minimize
temperature
fluctuations
.

We
tested
these
two
hypotheses
using
several
hundred
Eastern
Bluebirds
nesting
in
dark
(
hot
)
and
light
(
cool
)
nest
boxes
over
the
course
of
a
five
-
month
breeding
season
.

If
nest
size
reflects
female
quality
,
one
would
expect
a
correlation
between
nest
size
and
clutch
size
for
females
nesting
at
similar
times
in
the
season
.

If
nest
size
reflects
responses
to
thermal
conditions
,
one
would
expect
a
significant
difference
in
nest
size
for
females
nesting
in
hot
vs.
cool
boxes
at
the
same
point
in
the
breeding
season
.

we
repeated
a

In
June

,
23
RI
salt
marshes
were
surveyed
in
their
entirety
for
the
presence
of
breeding
Seaside

We
compared
aerial
photographs
from
1981
and
2003
to
document
landscape
changes
within
a
0.5-km
zone
surrounding
each
marsh
.

Seaside
Sparrow
counts
decreased
markedly
from
1982
to
2007
.

Counts
decreased
at
13
of
the
14
marshes
where
Seaside
Sparrows
had
been
found
in
1982
and
Seaside
Sparrows
were
present
on
only
seven
marshes
in
2007
(
including
two
where
no
Seaside
Sparrows
were
found
in
1982
Preliminary
analysis
suggests
that
the
degree
of
decline
in
Seaside
Sparrow
numbers
was
correlated
with
increased
residential
development
within
0.5
km
of
marsh
borders
.

Marshes
with
increased
adjacent
residential
development
exhibited
large
declines
(
44
-
100
in
Seaside
Sparrow
numbers
,
while
marshes
largely
bordered
by
protected
or
agricultural
land
demonstrated
smaller
decreases
(
0
-
21
or
slight
increases
.

We
will
repeat
the
survey
in
2008
to
assess
annual
variation
in
bird
numbers
.

SOCIAL

IN
BREEDING
SITE
SELECTION
BY
A
MIGRANT
SONGBIRD

To
maximize
fitness
,
organisms
must
assess
and
select
suitable
habitat
.

Early
research
studying
birds
suggested
that
organisms
consider
primarily
vegetation
structural
cues
in
their
habitat
choices
.

We
show
that
experimental
exposure
to
singing
in
the
postbreeding
period
provides
a
social
cue
that
is
used
for
habitat
selection
the
following
year
by
a
migrant
songbird
,
the
black
-
throated
blue
warbler
(
Dendroica
caerulescens
Our
experimental
social
cues
coerced
individuals
to
adopt
territories
in
areas
of
very
poor
habitat
quality
where
individuals
typically
do
not
occur
.

This
indicates
that
social
information
can
over
-
ride
typical
associations
with
vegetation
structure
.

We
demonstrate
that
a
strong
settlement
response
was
elicited
because
post
-
breeding
song
at
a
site
is
highly
correlated
with
reproductive
success
.

These
results
constitute
a
previously
undocumented
,
but
highly
parsimonious
mechanism
for
the
inadvertent
transfer
of
reproductive
(
public
)
information
from
successful
breeders
to
dispersers
.

We
hypothesize
that
postbreeding
song
is
a
pervasive
and
reliable
cue
for
species
that
communicate
vocally
,
inhabit
temporally
autocorrelated
environments
,
produce
young
asynchronously
and/or
abandon
territories
after
reproductive
failure
.

A
MIGRATORY
SONGBIRD

The
timing
of
settlement
decisions
likely
influences
the
quality
of
breeding
site
choices
for
migratory
birds
because
the
conditions
that
enhance
breeding
success
are
often
not
apparent
upon
arrival
after

.

We
used
a

estimate
apparent

among

Because
individuals
should
disperse
to
sites
that
maximize

,
we
hypothesized
that
warblers

would
move
up
a
habitat

gradient
when
opportunities
arose
.

Occupancy
models
revealed
substantial
support
for
apparent
movement
of
individuals
within
the
breeding
season
.

The
mean
probability
of
emigration
from
a

was
0.21
0.03
SE
and
the
mean
probability
of
immigration
to
a

was
0.51
0.05

A
portion
of
the
black

blue
warbler
population
appears
to
arrive
on
the
breeding

and
settle
initially
in
sub

habitat
,
moving
subsequently
into
high
quality
densely

habitat
at

This

approach
provides
a
new
means
to
test
hypotheses
about

by
using

SUBIS</EM
How
are
population
dynamics
of
neo
-
tropical
migratory
songbirds
going
to
be
affected
by
climate
change
?

To
study
this
question
,
first
we
related
20
years
(
1987
-
2007
)
of
band
/
re
-
sighting
and
nesting
records
(
N=3833
)
collected
by
the
Purple
Martin
Conservation
Association
(
PMCA
)
in
Northwestern
Pennsylvania
to
the
El
Nino
Southern
Oscillation
(
ENSO
)
Index
and
local
weather
variables
such
as
mean
air
temperature
and
precipitation
in
spring
.

Second
,
we
are
developing
a
mechanistic
population
model
that
will
forecast
the
consequences
of
climate
change
on
the
population
dynamics
of
this
species
into
the
future
.

This
is
critical
considering
that
the
Intergovernmental
Panel
on
Climate
Change
(
IPCC
)
has
predicted
that
by
2100
Pennsylvania
will
be
1.4o-5.8
o
C
warmer
,
20
-
50
%
wetter
and
frequented
by
extreme
hot
days
and
intense
weather
events
.

The
Purple
Martin
is
an
ideal
species
for
inquiries
of
this
kind
because
they
are
obligate
aerial
insectivores
.

They
are
vulnerable
to
starvation
and
heating
or
freezing
during
prolonged
or
extreme
weather
events
.

I
will
present
preliminary
data
that
has
implications
for
Purple

in
any

experiencing
local

RELATIONSHIP
AMONG
NEST
PREDATION
,
NEST
SIZE
,
AND
,
CLUTCH
SIZE
IN
ALTRICIAL
BIRDS

The
nest
size
hypothesis
posits
that
nest
predation
risk
selects
against
larger
and
more
conspicuous
nests
thus
favoring
the
evolution
of
smaller
nest
size
.

At
the
same
time
,
smaller
nests
may
constrain
clutch
size
.

This
hypothesis
may
explain
smaller
clutch
sizes
observed
in
tropical
versus
north
temperate
birds
.

Yet
,
comparative
analyses
for
different
regions
of
the
world
and
experimental
tests
of
this
hypothesis
are
lacking
.

Using
data
from
4282
nests
of
36
species
of
open
cup
-
nesting
bird
from
Arizona
and
Venezuela
,
we
tested
three
predictions
of
this
hypothesis
1
)
nest
predation
risk
is
positively
correlated
with
nest
size
2
)
clutch
size
is
positively
correlated
with
nest
size
,
and
(
3
)
nest
size
is
smaller
in
tropical
than
in
north
temperate
birds
controlling
for
body
mass
.

We
found
that
nest
predation
risk
was
strongly
correlated
with
nest
size
measured
as
surface
area
of
the
nest
.

Yet
,
nest
size
did
not
differ
between
regions
when
controlling
for
body
mass
.

Our
results
indicate
that
while
larger
nests
may
be
subject
to
higher
nest
predation
across
species
,
clutch
size
is
not
constrained
by
nest
size
.

WATERBIRDS
Waterbirds
with
distinct
nesting
requirements
(
guilds
)
may
respond
differently
to
ecosystem
disturbances
that
leave
variable
types
or
amounts
of
upland
cover
.

We
investigated
the
influence
of
recent
forest
fire
and
logging
on
the
abundance
of
waterbirds
on
wetlands
in
boreal
mixedwood
forest
.

Overall
,
we
predicted
that
waterbird
abundance
would
vary
negatively
with
amount
of
total
disturbance
(
fire
and
logging
)
with
logging
having
a
greater
impact
than
fire
.

Predicted
guild
responses
were
based
on
presumed
changes
in
available
upland
vegetation
.

We
conducted
aerial
surveys
of
reference
landscapes
(
n=326
)
and
landscapes
that
were
recently
logged
(
n=73
)
or
burned
(
n=46
correcting
for
detectability
using
a
double
observer
method
.

Using
Generalized
Linear
Models
with
quasipoisson
errors
,
and
controlling
for
effects
of
wetland
perimeter
,
we
found
that
overall
waterbird
abundance
was
lower
in
disturbed
landscapes
.

However
,
contrary
to
prediction
,
bird
abundance
was
similar
in
burned
and
logged
landscapes
.

We
did
not
detect
strong
guild
-
specific
differences
,
except
that
cavity
nesters
were
less
abundant
in
burned
landscapes
and
overwater
nesters
were
less
abundant
in
logged
landscapes
.

We
discuss
our
results
in
the
context
of
natural
disturbance

collapsed
from
approximately
1,200

to
107
in
the
early
1970s
.

The
decline
,
mirrored
in

,
was
linked
to
the
extensive
application
of
DDT

Following
US
banning
of
DDT
in

recovered
more
rapidly
than

the

was
not

The

rebounded
before
those

:
the

has
not

the
densities
it
once
enjoyed
;
the
Martha

has
grown
from
2
pairs
to
over
60
thanks
to
the
provisioning
of

POPULATION
GENETICS
OF
THE
RECENT
COLONIZATION
OF
ARGENTINA

BY
BREEDING
BARN
SWALLOWS

In
1980
,
six
pairs
of
Barn
Swallow

Hirundo
rustica</em
were
discovered
breeding
in
Argentina
,
within
the
species
wintering
range
.

Today
,
thousands
of
pairs
breed
along
the
coast
between
Mar
del
Plata
and
Bahia
Blanca
.

We
are
exploring
the
genetics
of
this
population
to
determine
whether
this
colonization
was
associated
with
a
substantial
genetic
founder
event
.

We
assayed
allelic
diversity
at
eight
microsatellite
loci
in
five
populations
;
three
from
Argentina
and
two
from
North
America
(
California
and
New
York

Although
there
was
significant
differentiation
among
some
populations
,
Fst
values
were
universally
small
,
and
we
found
no
evidence
for
a
population
bottleneck
in
the
Argentina
populations
relative
to
the
North
American
populations
.

Comparisons
based
on
mitochondrial
ND2
haplotype
diversities
also
show
no
evidence
for
a
Southern
Hemisphere
founder
event
.

These
findings
raise
the
possibility
of
ongoing
gene
flow
between
the
North
American
and
Argentinean
breeding
populations
,
and
suggest
that
a
substantial
number
of
individual
Barn
Swallows
have
shifted
their
breeding
cycle
by
six
months
when
colonizing
Argentina
.

are
often
considered
a
critical
nesting
resource
for
other
cavity

species
within
the
longleaf

ecosystem
.

Over
4
years
,
we
located
the
nests
of
cavity

nesting
birds
in
an
old

growth
longleaf
forest
.

We
found
that
>
80
%
viable
RCW
cavities
went
unused
annually
,
suggesting
cavities
were
not

in
this
mature

.

The
majority
of
nests
occurred
in
pine

.

To
examine
factors
influencing

,
we
tested
the
hypothesis
that
RCW
cavities
in
living
pine
incur
a
greater
risk
of
rat
snake

than
cavities
in
pine

.

We

THE

NOISE
PLAYBACK
ON
LEK
ATTENDANCE
AND
BEHAVIOR
IN
GREATER
SAGE
-
GROUSE

The
spread
of
human
development
has
caused
a
dramatic
increase
in
noise
across
the
landscape
.

Recent
studies
suggest
that
noise
may
negatively
impact
wildlife
,
yet
we
still
know
little
about
the
causes
and
consequences
of
this
impact
.

Further
,
most
previous
studies
have
not
been
designed
to
isolate
noise
impacts
from
other
confounding
factors
.

We
are
investigating
the
impacts
of
energy
development
noise
on
greater
sage
-
grouse
em
>

Centrocercus
urophasianus</em
a
species
of
management
concern
across

North
America
.

Sage
-
grouse
are
declining
in
areas
of
energy
development
and
circumstantial
evidence
suggests
that
noise
is
a
cause
of
this
decline
.

To
test
this
hypothesis
,
we
monitored
control
leks
and
leks
with
experimentally
-
introduced
energy
development
noise
.

We
will
present
results
from
three
seasons
of
experimental
noise
playback
,
comparing
lek
attendance
,
territory
selection
,
and
display
behavior
between
noise
and
control
leks
.

This
is
the
first
long
-
term
playback
experiment
investigating
the
chronic
impacts
of
noise
on
any
wild
population
,
offering
a
unique
opportunity
to
experimentally
address
noise
impacts
on
avian
behavior
and
breeding
site
selection
while
informing
conservation
efforts
for
this

SURPRISING
GENETIC
DIVERSITY

IN
A
MALAGASY
SONGBIRD

Spectacled
Tetraka

Xanthomixis
zosterops</em
is
an
endemic
Malagasy
passerine
,
formerly
considered
a
member
of
the
greenbul
family
,
Pycnonotidae
,
but
now
known
to
be
part
of
an
endemic
radiation
.

It
inhabits
the
eastern
humid
slope
forest
for
the
entire
length
of
Madagascar
.

Contrary
to
the
majority
of
Madagascar
's
bird
species
,
the
Spectacled
Tetraka
exhibits
substantial
intraspecific
genetic
structure
.

Four
distinct
mitochondrial
haplotype
clades
were
discovered
,
with
more
than
5
%
divergence
at
the
deepest
split
.

Surprisingly
,
these
clades
reflect
little
geographic
structure
.

One
clade
exclusively
inhabits
northern
Madagascar
,
but
the
remaining
three
clades
are
largely
sympatric
along
the
eastern
slope
of
the
island
,
despite
the
more
than
5
%
genetic
divergence
.

These
three
cryptic
clades
do
not
exhibit
noticeable
differences
in
plumage
,
vocalizations
,
or
habitat
preference
.

Multiple
sampling
sites
along
the
eastern
slope
support
individuals
from
all
three
haplotypes
.

We
hypothesize
that
the
clades
diverged
in
allopatry
and
are
now
in
widespread
secondary
contact
.

This
broad
sympatry
of
highly
divergent
clades
is
possibly
unique
for
birds
and
may
have
important
implications
regarding
speciation
and
the
classification
of
allopatric
cryptic
taxa
.

FACTORS
AFFECTING
MALLARD

DUCKLING
SURVIVAL
IN
WESTERN
CANADA
:

IMPLICATIONS
FOR
LANDSCAPELEVEL
CONSERVATION
PLANNING
.

Despite
considerable
recent
work
on
duckling
survival
rates
,
uncertainty
remains
concerning
how
abiotic
and
biotic
factors
affect
survival
.

Additionally
,
the
role
of
upland
habitat
characteristics
may
be
important
but
has
largely
been
ignored
.

Thus
,
we
re
-
evaluate
hypothesized
sources
of
variation
in
mallard
lt;em&gt;Anas
platyrhynchos&lt;/em&gt
duckling
survival
,
with
emphasis
on
assessing
possible
effects
of
managed
and
remnant
natural
upland
habitats
.

We
also
address
unresolved
questions
about
how
precocial
birds
balance
costs
and
benefits
of
selecting
specific
habitats
by
testing
the
hypothesis
that
female
mallards
select
brood
habitats
that
result
in
higher
duckling
survival
.

Theoretically
,
preferred
habitats
are
those
where
ducklings
have
higher
survival
rates
.

Data
were
collected
during
the
Prairie
Habitat
Joint
Venture
Assessment
Study
,
an
eight
-
year
,
27-site
,
multi
-
province
investigation
.

Between
1993
and
2000
gt;3,500
adult
female
mallards
were
trapped
and
marked
with
radio
transmitters
,
and
850
birds
provided
brood
habitat
use
and
duckling
survival
information
.

Upland
,
wetland
,
hen
and
brood
-
related
variables
were
used
to
explain
variation
in
duckling
survival
rates
.

Results
will
clarify
causes
and
consequences
of
habitat
selection
in
birds
,
as
well
as
contribute
to
waterfowl
conservation
and

planning

DOES

BEGGING
LEAD
TO
EXAGGERATED

Begging
displays
of
brood
parasitic
offspring
are
predicted
to
be
more
exaggerated
than
closely

,
non

species
.

In
this

,
we
assessed
whether
the
begging
displays
of
parasitic
Brown

Cowbird
(
Molothrus

)
chicks
differed
from
those
of
a

the
Red

Blackbird
(
Agelaius

when

In
addition
,
we
assessed
how
begging
displays
of
cowbirds
and
blackbirds
influenced
the
amount
of
food
that
was
delivered
to
the
nest
by
vireo
parents
.

We
found
that
cowbirds
did
not
beg
in
a
more
exaggerated
manner
than
blackbirds
for
all
begging
metrics
;
indeed
,
the
begging
posture
of
blackbird
chicks
was
significantly
higher
than
for
cowbird
chicks
.

Vireos
provided
a
similar
amount
of
food
to
cowbird
and
blackbird
chicks
,
although
the
amount
was
significantly
lower
than
that
the
amount
provisioned
to
a
modal
vireo
brood
.

These
results
suggest
cowbirds
share
exaggerated
begging
displays
with
a
non
-
parasitic
close
relative
,
but
that
exaggerated
begging
displays
do
not
increase
food

MECHANICS
AND
STRUCTURE
OF
AVIAN
APPENDAGES

In
the
recent
trend
toward
biomimetics
,
engineers
and
materials
scientists
have
turned
to
the
birds
for
design
inspirations
.

Members
of
the
avian
class
typically
have
hard
and
rigid
anatomical
parts
which
are
engaged
for
purposes
of
protection
,
foraging
,
and
locomotion
.

Of
the
approximately
10,000
species
of
modern
birds
,
only
about
40
are
unflighted
;
therefore
,
for
most
birds
the
mechanical
competency
of
the
bill
and
other
integumentary
structures
must
be
balanced
with
low
weight
.

This
study
of
rostrum
,
feathers
,
and
claw
/
talon
is
devoted
to
the
materials
(
e.g.
keratin
and
mineralized
collagen
)
and
structures
.

Furthermore
,
we
attempt
to
elucidate
the
role
of
structural
conformation
of
constituent
materials
in
the
mechanical
response
of
avian
appendages
.

We
tracked

in
Argentina
.

Penguins
swam
shorter
distances
(

In

DOES
FOLIAGE
DENSITY
REDUCE
THE
RISK
OF
NEST
PREDATION
?

INSIGHTS
FROM
A
COMPARATIVE
ANALYSIS
Foliage
surrounding
a
nest
is
thought
to
reduce
the
risk
of
nest
predation
,
but
studies
examining
this
relationship
have
produced
inconsistent
results
.

To
determine
the
cause
of
these
equivocal
results
,
we
reviewed
studies
that
examined
the
effect
of
foliage
density
on
the
risk
of
nest
predation
in
North
American
passerines
.

Surprisingly
,
more
than
75
%
of
the
studies
reported
that
increased
foliage
density
does
not
reduce
the
risk
of
nest
predation
.

However
,
the
importance
of
foliage
density
in
reducing
nest
predation
may
not
be
as
straight
forward
as
previously
thought
because
several
sources
of
bias
have
been
ignored
in
past
studies
.

For
example
,
timing
of
measurements
can
create
bias
because
the
amount
of
foliage
surrounding
a
nest
often
increases
as
the
breeding
season
8/4/2008AOU
/
COS
/
SCO

,
OR

progresses
.

Thus
,
any
differences
observed
between
successful
and
unsuccessful
nests
may
be
an
artifact
of
seasonal
phenology
of
foliage
growth
.

Studies
that
measured
foliage
density
by
visual
assessment
more
frequently
reported
that
foliage
density
did
not
reduce
nest
predation
compared
to
studies
using
more
rigorous
methods
.

Measurement
scale
also
influenced
whether
researchers
detected
a
positive
relationship
.

WHAT
EVERY
ORNITHOLOGIST
SHOULD
KNOW
ABOUT
MUSEUMS
Museums
represent
huge
resources
for
the
ornithological
community
,
yet
the
breadth
and
depth
of
those
resources
remain
unfamiliar
to
many
in
the
ornithological
community
who
might
benefit
from
them
.

In
an
effort
to
bridge
this
gap
,
we
will
present
an
introduction
to
museums
and
the
ways
in
which
any
ornithologist
might
interact
with
them
.

We
begin
with
an
overview
of
ornithological
collections
:
what
types
of
data
are
available
in
museums
,
who
manages
and
curates
these
data
and
how
,
and
the
kinds
of
scientific
questions
that
can
be
addressed
using
museum
data
.

We
then
provide
an
introduction
to
the
larger
museum
community
by
introducing
the
largest
and
most
active
North
American
ornithological
collections
,
including
the
relative
size
of
their
holdings
and
where
they
are
located
.

Finally
,
we
review
the
ways
in
which
ornithologists
may
interact
with
museums
:

what
resources
and
training
museums
offer
if
an
ornithologist
wants
to
collect
or
possess
birds
or
their
parts
during
the
course
of
their
research
,
how
ornithologists
can
deposit
specimens
in
museums
,
and
how
ornithologists
can
access
museum
specimens
and
data
.

THE
EFFECTS
OF
HYDROLOGICAL
VARIATION
ON
SEASONAL
WADING
BIRD
PREY

CONCENTRATIONS
IN
THE
EVERGLADES

The
linkage
among
hydrology
,
prey
populations
and
wading
bird
nesting
is
a
core
hypothesis
underlying
the
Everglades
restoration
.

However
,
the
quantitative
linkage
has
not
yet
been
established
from
field
data
.

We
quantified
prey
concentrations
throughout
the
Everglades
during
the
dry
seasons
of
2005
,
2006
,
and
2007
,
three
years
with
differing
hydrology
and
wading
bird
nesting
.

We
sampled
prey
at
both
random
sites
and
wading
bird
foraging
sites
.

Multiple
rainfall
events
during
the
2005
dry
season
interrupted
the
seasonal
recession
causing
low
prey
densities
and
nest
abandonment
by
wading
birds
.

High
water
at
the
start
of
the
2006
dry
season
followed
by
a
steady
recession
produced
the
highest
prey
densities
and
biomass
and
it
was
a
year
of
high
wading
bird
nesting
.

Limited
wet
season
rainfall
in
2006
led
to
drought
conditions
in
2007
,
poor
wading
bird
nesting
and
low
prey
biomass
,
mostly
from
a
reduction
in
abundance
of
large
prey
.

Prey
densities
at
foraging
sites
tended
to
be
greater
than
at
random
sites
except
in
2006
,
suggesting
that
preferable
foraging
patches
were
more
available
in
the
landscape
that
year
.

AN

is
a
fatal

attributed
to
over
100

in
the

We
combined

to
determine
the

EARLIER

LAYING
DATES
OF
BALD
EAGLES
IN
MICHIGAN
--
EFFECTS
OF
CLIMATE
CHANGE
?

The
Michigan
population
of
bald
eagles
has
been
studied
since
1961
and
virtually
all
reproductive
outcomes
are
known
since
1963
.

We
utilized
morphometric
measurements
of
nestlings
at
banding
to
determine
first
laying
date
in
over
2300
breeding
attempts
from
1988
-
2006
.

We
examined
first
laying
date
at
5
geographic
scales
to
determine
if
any
trends
were
evident
.

We
found
both
significant
and
inverse
trends
in
Julian
date
for
first
laying
date
that
averaged
0.3d
/
yr
over
this
time
period
.

Some
individual
nests
have
seen
first
laying
date
decrease
by
14d
.

It
is
apparent
that
milder
winters
are
associated
with
this
trend
of
earlier
laying
dates
for
eagles
in
Michigan
.

COMPARATIVE
PHYLOGEOGRAPHY
OF
EAST
AND
SOUTHERN
AFRICAN
COASTAL
FOREST
BIRDS

The
bird
fauna
of
African
montane
and
lowland
forests
have
long
been
know
to
harbor
distinct
communities
,
yet
hypotheses
on
the
origins
of
this
diversity
remain
controversial
.

It
is
broadly
accepted
that
during
periods
when
higher
latitudes
were
glaciated
,
the
African
tropics
became
more
arid
,
resulting
in
the
reduction
of
montane
and
lowland
forests
.

As
a
consequence
both
montane
and
lowland
forest
bird
distribution
patterns
have
been
interpreted
within
the
context
of
classic
refugial
models
of
speciation
.

Here
we
present
phylogeographic
data
for
three
African
bird
species
primarily
restricted
to
coastal
forest
:
the
Green
Barbet
which
shows
an
extreme
disjunction
with
coastal
populations
isolated
in
South
Africa
and
Tanzania
,
the
Tiny
Greenbul
with
a
broader
coastal
and
montane
forest
distribution
in
East
Africa
and
a
disjunct
coastal
forest
population
in
southern
Africa
,
and
the
Sombre
Greenbul
which
is
continuously
distributed
in
coastal
forest
between
East
and
southern
Africa
.

Results
from
both
mtDNA
and
nDNA
reveal
significant
historical
structure
in
all
three
species
suggesting
that
past
climate
has
played
a
significant
role
in
shaping
patterns
of
diversification
in
African
coastal
forest
birds
.

THE
EARLY
BIRD
BREEDS
IN
THE
NORTH
:

SPRING
ARRIVAL
TIMING
IN
SWAINSON
'S
THRUSHES
Arrival
timing
at
breeding
sites
typically
influences
reproductive
success
in
passerines
.

Presumably
,
arrival
timing
at
stopover
sites
is
correlated
with
arrival
timing
at
breeding
sites
,
but
the
exact
relationship
between
the
two
is
not
well
understood
.

We
collected
data
on
arrival
timing
,
gender
,
age
,
stable
hydrogen
isotopes
in
feathers
,
and
wingtip
shape
for
Swainson
's
Thrushes
landing
on
the
coast
of
Louisiana
during
spring
migration
in
2007
.

Isotopic
signature
explained
approximately
96
%
of
the
variation
in
arrival
date
:
birds
whose
deuterium
values
suggested
that
they
bred
further
north
the
previous
year
arrived
earlier
than
birds
whose
signatures
indicated
that
they
had
bred
further
south
.

Wingtip
shape
did
not
explain
any
additional
variation
,
but
was
correlated
with
stable
isotope
signature
.

Comparing
our
data
to
other
studies
on
arrival
date
in
Swainson
's
Thrushes
suggests
that
northerly
breeders
may
be
overtaking
southerly
breeders
between
Costa
Rica
and
the
Gulf
coast
and
that
the
difference
in
arrival
timing
might
persist
until
the
thrushes
reach
the
breeding
grounds
.

This
has
interesting
implications
for
hypotheses
regarding
the
evolution
of
migration
since
it
appears
that
some
Swainson
's
Thrushes
may
fly
several
thousand
miles
over
suitable
but
unoccupied
habitat
before
they
settle
down
to
breed
.

PROCESSES
Differences
in
predators
and
in

along
urban
gradients
may
have
strong
effects
on
avian
demography
,
increasing
or
decreasing
potential
productivity
.

The
net
result
will
dictate
population
trends
of
individual
species
.

We
examined
sequential
changes
in
potential
productivity
(
the
maximum
number
of
yearlings
that
could
be
produced
per
pair
/
year
if
each
egg
resulted
in
a
yearling
)
in
suburban
and
wildland
populations
of
Florida
Scrub
-
Jays
.

Suburban
scrub
-
jays
produced
fewer
yearlings
,
but
laid
larger
clutches
,
renested
more
,
and
produced
more
second
broods
.

Nest
predation
did
not
differ
between
sites
.

Suburban
jays
had
more
hatching
failure
,
brood
reduction
,
and
post
-
fledging
mortality
than
did
wildland
jays
.

Brood
reduction
and
post
-
fledging
mortality
had
the
greatest
effect
on
reducing
potential
productivity
in
the
suburbs
.

Brood
reduction
resulted
from
starvation
of
later
-
hatched
nestlings
.

Post
-
fledging
mortality
likely
resulted
from
predation
,
but
was
more
strongly
associated
with
nestling
condition
in
the
suburbs
,
suggesting
an
interaction
between
nestling
quality
and
predation
.

Mortality
of
young
from
independence
to
yearling
was
actually
lower
in
the
suburbs
.

These
patterns
suggest
that
bottom
-
up
and
not
top
-
down
processes
limit
recruitment
in

CONSISTENT
ECOLOGICAL
SELECTIVITY
THROUGH
TIME
IN
PACIFIC
ISLAND
AVIAN
EXTINCTIONS

Can
prehistoric
avian
extinctions
on
Pacific
islands
be
used
to
model
extinction
risk
in
modern
birds
?

Using
remains
from
numerous
subfossil
assemblages
on
Pacific
islands
,
I
compiled
a
species
list
for
each
island
and
estimated
body
mass
and
dietary
habits
for
extinct
species
.

By
building
models
of
extinction
risk
based
on
paleoecological
and
historical
data
from
islands
across
the
Pacific
,
I
identified
ecological
factors
associated
with
avian
extinction
over
the
past
3500
years
.

Although
human
impacts
on
birds
and
their
habitats
may
have
changed
through
time
,
modern
endangered
birds
share
many
of
the
same
ecological
characteristics
as
victims
of
previous
extinction
waves
.

This
analysis
produced
species
-
specific
extinction
risk
predictions
based
on
ecology
and
previous
extinction
events
,
and
identified
several
species
in
need
of
conservation
attention
.

The
overarching
pattern
underscores
the
importance
of
endemism
and
body
size
on
extinction
risk
in
living
species
.

NEOTROPICAL

SONGBIRD
Much
remains
unknown
about
the
form
and
function
of
complex
vocal
signals
,
especially
in
tropical
birds
.

We
describe
the
acoustic
structure
and
temporal
variation
in
solos
,
duets
,
and
choruses
in
a
cooperatively
breeding
neotropical
passerine
,
Rufous
-
naped
Wrens
.

We
collected
focal
recordings
of
20
groups
to
assess
both
diel
and
seasonal
variation
in
vocal
output
,
as
well
as
population
-
wide
sharing
of
vocal
signals
.

We
found
that
birds
produce
a
complex
array
of
vocalizations
,
including
tonal
,
frequency
modulated
syllables
grouped
into
phrases
.

Songs
are
combined
into
duets
and
choruses
with
varying
phrase
type
-
matching
.

Solo
and
duet
songs
show
a
dawn
chorus
effect
,
and
solo
rate
,
but
not
duet
or
chorus
rates
,
varied
across
breeding
stages
.

The
majority
of
phrases
are
shared
among
groups
,
significantly
more
so
among
groups
in
nearby
territories
.

We
also
simulated
varying
degrees
of
territorial
threat
using
playback
,
and
found
that
groups
responded
similarly
to
solos
,
duets
,
and
choruses
.

We
argue
that
Rufous
-
naped
Wren
song
is
an
important
indicator
of
group
identity
and
functions
in
group
territorial
defence
.

This
is
the
first
quantitative
description
of
vocal
behaviour
in
this
species

NEST
GUARDING
:

A
STRATEGY
FOR
INCREASING
NESTING
SUCCESS
IN
FREE
-
FLYING
CALIFORNIA
CONDORS
Nest

is
a
primary
limiting
factor
in
the
achievement
of
population
viability
in
the
reintroduced
southern
California
population
of
California
condors

californianus</em

Many
of
the
factors
linked
to
nest
failure
were
previously
only
partially
documented
or
are
poorly
understood
as
to
mechanism
and
timing
.

Beginning
with
the
2007
season
,
we
implemented
a
nest
guarding
program
in
southern
California
with
the
goals
of
1
)
immediately
increasing
nesting
success
;
and
2
)
more
precisely
identifying
the
stages
at
which
and
mechanisms
by
which
nesting
attempts
are
breaking
down
so
that
we
can
ultimately
address
the
factors
contributing
to
failure
with
long
-
term
solutions
.

The
program
consists
of
nest
monitoring
by
trained
observers
,
during
which
quantitative
behavioral
data
are
collected
;
scheduled
nest
entries
,
during
which
morphometric

,
and

data
are

;
and
intervention

,
which
are

to

The
increase
in

success
from
a
6-year
mean
of
12.5
range
of
0
-
33
to
100
%
in
the

of
our
program
suggests
that
nest

is
a
successful
short

strategy
to
increase
nest
success
in
this
critically

FOR
MULTIPLE
LOSSES
OF
FLIGHT
IN
RATITE
BIRDS
Ratites
(
ostriches
,
emus
,
rheas
,
cassowaries
,
and
kiwis
)
are
large
,
flightless
birds
that
have
long
fascinated
biologists
.

Their
current
distribution
on
isolated
southern
land
masses
is
believed
to
reflect
the
breakup
of
the
paleocontinent
of
Gondwana
.

The
prevailing
view
is
that
ratites
are
monophyletic
,
with
the
flighted
tinamous
as
their
sister
group
,
suggesting
a
single
loss
of
flight
in
the
common
ancestry
of
ratites
.

However
,
phylogenetic
analyses
of
20
unlinked
nuclear
genes
reveal
a
genome
-
wide
signal
that
unequivocally
places
tinamous
within
ratites
,
making
ratites
polyphyletic
and
suggesting
multiple
losses
of
flight
.

Phenomena
that
can
mislead
phylogenetic
analyses
,
including
long
branch
attraction
,
base
compositional
bias
,
discordance
between
gene
trees
and
species
trees
,
and
sequence
alignment
errors
,
have
been
eliminated
as
explanations
for
this
result
.

The
most
plausible
hypothesis
requires
at
least
three
losses
of
flight
and
explains
the
many
morphological
and
behavioral
similarities
among
ratites
by
parallel
or
convergent
evolution
.

Finally
,
this
phylogeny
demands
fundamental
reconsideration
of
proposals
that
relate
ratite
evolution
to
continental
drift

The
ecologically
mediated
divergence
model
suggests
that
incipient
species
often
occur
in
different
ecological
settings
and
that
adaptations
to
such
settings
drive
evolutionary
divergence
.

In
contrast
,
the
phylogenetic
niche
conservatism
model
posits
that
certain
dimensions
of
the
niche
are
not
easily
modified
and
that
this
conservatism
causes
the
failure
to
adapt
to
new
environmental
conditions
.

We
present
preliminary
results
of
a
family
-
level
analysis
of
the
Thamnophilidae
that
integrates
phylogenetic
,
ecological
,
morphometric
,
vocal
,
and
geographic
occurrence
data
,
to
provide
insights
on
the
role
of
these
two
models
in
the
diversification
patterns
of
the
family
.

Preliminary
results
show
evidence
that
at
the
family
level
,
genetic
and
morphometric
pair
-
wise
distances
are
positively
correlated
,
which
is
consistent
with
the
predictions
under
the
phylogenetic
niche
conservatism
model
.

However
,
at
a
lower
taxonomic
scale
the
correlation
is
not
observed
.

We
found
that
some
phenotypic
traits
are
correlated
with
certain
ecological
features
,
also
pointing
to
a
possible
role
for
ecologically
mediated
selection
.

At
this
point
,
it
still
remains
unclear
are
the
scales
at
which
the
two
models
operate

THE
ROLE
OF
LANDSCAPE
COMPOSITION
AND
HABITAT
MANAGEMENT
IN
DETERMINING
BREEDING
PHILOPATRY
OF
GRASSLAND
PASSERINES
:

A
STABLE
ISOTOPE
APPROACH
Grassland
bird
populations
are
declining
across
North
America
.

Although
conversion
of
grassland
habitat
into
cropland
has
likely
been
a
main
contributor
to
this
decline
,
habitat
degradation
and
fragmentation
may
be
compounding
the
problem
.

Habitat
degradation
and
fragmentation
may
limit
successful
reproduction
and
therefore
influence
an
individual
's
choice
of
breeding
location
.

Little
is
known
about
dispersal
and
breeding
-
site
philopatry
in
grassland
songbirds
due
to
the
difficulty
in
tracking
using
conventional
mark
-
recapture
methods
.

However
,
recent
advances
in
stable
isotope
methods
now
make
it
possible
to
track
minimum
levels
of
dispersal
into
breeding
populations
in
North
America
.

Using
stable
-
hydrogen
isotope
analysis
of
feathers
grown
on
the
breeding
grounds
,
we
analyzed
how
landscape
quality
and
habitat
management
affect
the
breeding
philopatry
and
natal
dispersal
of
two
grassland
passerines
;
Sprague
's
Pipit
em
>

Anthus
spragueii
em
and
Savannah
Sparrow

Passerculus
sandwichensis

Furthermore
,
we
used
stable
-
hydrogen
isotope
analysis
to
determine
if
large
-
scale
patterns
in
rates
of
philopatry
and
dispersal
are
present
by
conducting
a
comparison
of
dispersal
rates
at
two
geographically
distinct
locations

NESTLING

PREDICTS
SUBADULT
PERSONALITY
IN
FLORIDA
SCRUB
-
JAYS
Environmental
conditions
during
early
development
may
profoundly
influence
adult
phenotype
and
behavior
.

This
phenomenon
is
well
documented
in
laboratory
studies
,
but
has
not
been
as
well
studied
in
wild
populations
.

We
measured
baseline
levels
of
corticosterone
(
the
primary
glucocorticoid
stress
hormone
in
birds
)
in
69
nestling
Florida
Scrub
-
Jays
em
>

Aphelocoma
coerulescens</em
and
performed
a
suite
of
behavioral
tests
on
10
of
the
same
individuals
approximately
six
months
later
.

We
observed
a
strong
positive
correlation
between
nestling
corticosterone
and
fearfulness
.

This
link
between
nestling
stress
physiology
and
subadult
behavior
could
indicate
that
a
genetic
predisposition
for
a
fearful
personality
is
manifested
as
early
as
11
days
post
hatching
in
the
form
of
high
stress
-
hormone
secretion
.

Alternatively
,
poor
conditions
in
the
nest
environment
may
increase
corticosterone
secretion
,
which
in
turn
directs
development
toward
a
more
fearful
phenotype
.

We
favor
the
latter
explanation
,
which
suggests
an
evolutionary
strategy
in
which
young
offspring
are
'
programmed
'
to
cope
with
current
environmental
conditions
during
the
crucial
post
-
fledgling
period

This

IN
CENTRAL

Greater
sage

grouse
are
found
only
in
sagebrush
habitats
.

Their
geographic
range
has
contracted
by
almost
half
its
original
area
over
the
last
150
years
,
primarily
due
to
habitat
alteration
and
degradation
.

During
winter
,
sage
-
grouse
are
dependent
on
sagebrush
for
food
and
cover
,
but
few
winter
ecological
data
are
available
.

We
measured
characteristics
of
winter
habitat
(
N=22
)
and
seasonal
movements
(
N=58
)
of
Greater
Sage
-
Grouse
in
central
Oregon
.

Individual
birds
moved
extensively
across
the
landscape
,
sometimes
greater
than
40
km
from
wintering
areas
to
breeding
sites
.

During
winter
,
sage
-
grouse
moved
less
on
average
per
day
than
during
spring
and
fall
.

Habitat
use
changed
in
different
ways
for
males
and
females
at
the
transition
from
winter
to
spring
.

Our
study
shows
that
sage

grouse
in
central
Oregon
move
over
a
substantial
area
during
their
annual
cycle
,
and
that
most
grouse
occupied
wintering
grounds
that
differed
from
summering
areas
.

Managers
interested
in
preserving
sage
-
grouse
populations
should
protect
very
large
areas
(
hundreds
to
thousands
of
square
km
)
of
habitat
and
ensure
that
a
diversity
of
habitat
types
are
available
for
the

SPECIATION
OF
STREAMERTAIL

HUMMINGBIRDS
ON
JAMAICA

The
limited
and
confined
geographic
area
of
oceanic
islands
makes
allopatric
differentiation
less
likely
to
occur
within
them
.

In
landbirds
,
there
are
no
documented
cases
of
allopatric
speciation
on
small
oceanic
islands
that
can
not
be
alternatively
explained
by
other
processes
,
such
as
secondary
colonization
.

We
show
that
two
species
of
hybridizing
streamertail
hummingbirds
(
Trochilus
)
diverged
in
situ
on
Jamaica
,
with
their
speciation
likely
facilitated
by
sexual
selection
during
a
recent
period
of
geographic
isolation
.

Streamertail
hummingbirds
are
highly
volant
,
yet
bill
color
,
the
secondary
sexual
ornament
that
distinguishes
the
two
species
,
changes
from
ruby
red
(
T.
polytmus
)
to
jet
black
(
T.
scitulus
)
over
only
7
kilometers
.

A
genome
scan
based
on
AFLP
markers
,
three
unlinked
nuclear
loci
,
and
the
mitochondrial
control
region
found
little
genetic
differentiation
between
the
two
species
that
would
support
the
existence
of
post
-
mating
reproductive
isolating
mechanisms
.

Instead
,
our
data
suggest
differences
in
secondary
sexual
ornaments
and
behavior
act
as
strong
pre
-
mating
deterrents
to
hybridization

Western
Wyoming
is
undergoing
increased
human
population
growth
,
caused
primarily
by
increased

,
augmented
by
seasonal

.

As
towns
expand
to
accommodate
the

of

,
these

may
inadvertently
subsidize
native
wildlife
species
by
providing

,
and

,
thereby

USING
METALS
IN
FEATHERS
AS
AN
INDICATOR
OF
GEOGRAPHICAL
AND
HABITAT
VARIATION
.

Studying
patterns
of
metals
in
tissues
(
particularly
feathers
)
can
be
useful
in
understanding
differences
in
habitats
used
for
foraging
,
and
in
examining
geographical
differences
,
both
in
local
areas
and
over
greater
regions
.

Information
about
molt
patterns
and
migratory
patterns
is
essential
to
understand
where
exposure
occurred
.

Metal
levels
in
feathers
of
adults
provide
information
about
exposure
during
feather
formation
,
which
could
occur
on
the
wintering
or
breeding
grounds
.

In
contrast
,
metal
levels
in
feathers
of
young
prior
to
fledging
reflect
local
exposure
.

Further
,
metal
level
vary
as
a
function
of
foraging
locations
,
trophic
level
,
and
age
,
with
birds
feeding
at
higher
trophic
levels
accumulating
higher
levels
of
metals
(
particularly
mercury
Older
birds
generally
manifest
higher
levels
than
young
birds
.

Using
seabird
examples
from
the
Aleutians
,
Minnesota
,
and
New
Jersey
,
we
illustrate
how
metal
levels
can
provide
information
about
trophic
levels
,
foraging
locations
,
and
geographic
variations
.

INVOLVING
STAKEHOLDERS
IN
SELECTION
OF
AVIAN
BIOINDICATORS
OF
RADIONUCLIDES
AND
MERCURY
.

We
describe
involvement
of
stakeholders
in
selecting
avian
bioindicators
of
environmental
contamination
at
Amchitka
Island
(
Aleutians
to
ensure
that
the
species
were
important
to
both
resource
managers
and
Aleut
subsistence
hunters
.

In
2000
,
the
Department
of
Energy
announced
closure
of
Amchitka
where
three
underground
nuclear
tests
(
1965
-
1971
)
had
occurred
.

Stakeholder
groups
concerned
about
human
and
ecologic
health
,
required
an
intensive
sampling
of
the
marine
environment
,
including
seabirds
.

We
engaged
a
wide
range
of
stakeholders
to
identify
appropriate
invertebrate
,
fish
,
and
avian
species
for
analysis
including
the
USFWS
,
the
State
of
Alaska
,
the
Aleutian
/
Pribilof
Island
Association
,
commercial
fisheries
,
conservation
organizations
,
and
remote
Aleut
communities
.

These
groups
provided
an
iterative
input
to
the
design
,
revision
,
implementation
and
analysis
of
the
study
.

The
process
resulted
in
selection
of
Pigeon
Guillemot
,
Tufted
Puffin
,
Common
Eider
,
Glaucous
-
winged
Gull
,
and
Bald
Eagle
(
eggs
,
feathers
)
to
be
collected
at
Amchitka
and
a
reference
site
Kiska
.

The
process
optimized
stakeholder
input
,
resulted
in
a
sound
scientific
protocol
,
and
assured
the
relevance
of
the
results
.

This
provides
a
model

designing
sampling
plans

EM
>

COLINUS
VIRGINIANUS</EM

Most
northern
bobwhite
nests
are
incubated
by
a
single
adult
of
either
sex
.

We
assessed
attendance
patterns
and
parental
investment
in
bobwhite
clutches
(
n=31
)
using
continuous
near
-
infrared
video
of
nests
being
incubated
by
male
or
female
bobwhites
.

We
found
that
incubating
parents
took
0
-
3
recesses
per
day
.

A
single
recess
was
most
common
on
82
%
of
days
and
most
of
these
were
during
12:00
-
19:00

.

Mean
daily

was
longer
for
failed

)
than
for
successful
nests
(
mean=180.3

min

We
observed
no
difference
between
the
sexes
in
the
number
or
length
of
recesses
taken
,
but
females
(

initiated
recess
later
in
the
day
than
males
(

SPARROWNET
:

A
DIGITAL
RADIO
TAG
NETWORK
FOR
MONITORING

SONGBIRD
SOCIAL
INTERACTIONS

Our
study
of
song
sparrow
social
networks
requires
that
many
birds
be
continuously
monitored
for
extended
periods
of
time
.

Conventional
radio
tracking
is
unsuitable
for
our
application
because
it
only
allows
monitoring
while
a
human
is
manually
tracking
the
bird
,
while
automated
tracking
systems
are
not
feasible
for
our
field
site
.

Our
alternative
solution
to
this
tracking
problem
is
Sparrownet
,
a
microprocessor
based
digital
radio
tag
technology
that
allows
autonomous
monitoring
of
the
proximity
of
each
tagged
bird
to
all
other
nearby
tagged
birds
on
a
continuous
basis
.

Sparrownet
consists
of
two
components
:
small
"
roving
node
"
transceiver
tags
mounted
on
all
focal
birds
,
and
"
collection
node
"
transceiver
devices
placed
at
fixed
locations
in
the
field
.

Roving
node
tags
periodically
beacon
a
unique
ID
number
,
which
other
roving
nodes
in
range
receive
and
log
to
memory
.

Collection
nodes
upload
encounter
logs
from
in
-
range
roving
nodes
,
where
they
are
stored
for
later
retrieval
.

The
resulting
dataset
is
a
record
of
all
interactions
between
all
tagged
individuals
.

Current
roving
node
tags
weigh
approximately
1
g
and
employ
energy
harvesting
technology
to
extend
their
lifespan
.

NEW
EVIDENCE
OF
EARLY
NORTH
AMERICAN
PRESENCE
OF
CYGNUS
OLOR

We
evaluated
the
long
-
standing
hypothesis
that
Mute
Swan
Cygnus
olor
is
introduced
,
i.e
not
native
,
to
the
United
States
.

Although
there
have
been
very
few
studies
of
the
species
,
there
is
significant
evidence
that
Cygnus
olor
occurred
pre
-
European
colonization
and
is
,
in
fact
,
a
circumboreal
species
,
historically
.

We
researched
early
journals
to
recent
papers
,
showing
presence
through
accepted
,
documented
,
first
and
last
dates
of
seasonal
migrations
and
areas
of
occurrence
of
all
North
American
swan
species
on
the
American
continent
;
confirmation
of
presence
in
Kamchatka
and
Alaska
;
inclusion
in
the
John
White
drawings
of
1585
Virginia
;
a
confirmed
specimen
(
1650
-
1675
)
from
James
Bay
Canada
and
confirmed
(
through
federal
court
documents
)
regular
migration
from
Hudson
Bay
area
into
the
United
States
.

We
suggest
that
a
review
of
this
extensive
data
will
prompt
a
revaluation
of
the
status
of
Cygnus
olor
in
the
United
States
.

BACTERIAL
DEGRADATION
OF
FEATHERS
UNDER
SIMULATED
PLUMAGE
CONDITIONS
.

Recent
papers
on
bacterial
degradation
of
feathers
have
assumed
that
such
degradation
occurs
on
the
bird
.

Testing
this
assumption
is
difficult
as
the
plumage
of
live
birds
can
not
be
sterilized
and
re
-
inoculated
in
a
controlled
experiment
that
isolates
the
effect
of
feather
-
degrading
bacteria
nor
have
we
been
able
to
eliminate
the
various
adaptations
that
seem
to
regulate
bacterial
presence
in
the
plumage
.

We
have
approached
plumage
conditions
in
the
laboratory
by
suspending
sterilized
feathers
inoculated
with
bacteria
in
sealed
jars
in
which
humidity
varied
from
35
%
to
100
%
to
100
%
with
simulated
rain
.

After
four
months
incubation
at
body
temperature
all
feathers
exposed
to
<
em
>

Bacillus
licheniformis</em
>
only
or
<
em
>

Streptomyces
fradiae</em
>
only
,
all
feathers
were
damaged
.

Feathers
exposed
to
a
microbial
community
taken
from
the
plumage
of
a
live
songbird
immediately
after
capture
showed
little
damage
.

These
data
suggest
that
feather
-
degrading
bacteria
have
the
potential
to
damage
feathers
on
live
birds
,
but
competition
among
species
in
a
typical
plumage
microbial
community
prevents
much
of
the
damage
.

The
bird
may
regulate
community
structure
through
maintenance
behavior
,
feather
pigments
,
or
preen
oil
composition
.

Conservation
-
related
field
research
using
endocrinology
focuses
on
measuring
glucocorticoid
hormones
(
corticosterone
or
cortisol
)
as
a
marker
for
stress
.

The
goals
of
this
talk
are
to
1
)
summarize
select
field
-
based
studies
,
2
)
discuss
challenges
in
interpretation
of

,
and
3
)
evaluate
how
well

inform

Results
from
studies
relating
a
single
environmental
variable
,
such
as
predator
density
or
food
abundance
,
to
glucocorticoid
levels
typically
follow
expected
predictions
.

However
,
data
from
studies
involving
simultaneous
change
in
multiple
environmental
variables
,
such
as
habitat
degradation
,
are
difficult
to
interpret
whether
or
not
glucocorticoid
levels
change
.

Field
results
indicate
that
glucocorticoid
levels
can
correlate
to
and
predict
mortality
and
reproductive
success
,
but
the
relationships
among
glucocorticoid
levels
and
these
fitness
parameters
are
complex
.

Using
examples
from
the
field
,
we
will
present
data
-
based
conceptual
models
that
focus
on
the
conundrum
of
how
to
interpret
glucocorticoid
data
.

The
aim
of
these
conceptual
models
is
to
help

The
genetic
diversity
of
populations
inhabiting
unique
and
marginal
habitats
is
expected
to
be
altered
by
anthropogenic

and
range
periphery
.

We
used
a
population
of
Greater
Sage
-
Grouse
(
Centrocercus
urophasianus
)
that
contained
both
a
declining
,
fragmented
periphery
and
a
stable
,
contiguous
core
to
examine
the
genetic
influence
of
periphery
and
fragmentation
.

We
genotyped
2519
individuals
from
104
leks
in
Alberta
,
Saskatchewan
,
Montana
,
and
Wyoming
at
13
microsatellite
loci
.

Two
populations
were
identified
:
Northern
Montana
and
the
Powder
River
Basin
.

Northern
Montana
exhibited
great
genetic
diversity
and
significant
isolation
by
distance
,
with
the
Milk
River
separating
the
two
subpopulations
.

Both
subpopulations
had
high
genetic
diversity
with
no
support
for
peripheral
regions
being
genetically
depauperate
or
highly
structured
compared
to
core
areas
.

Analysis
of
molecular
variance
revealed
that
the
lek
contained
the
majority
of
genetic
variation
.

Patterns
of
isolation
by
distance
and
assignment
demonstrated
that
Northern
Montana
Sage

are
capable
of
dispersing
over

Sage

are
maintaining

Plasma
corticosterone
concentration
often
increases

exposed

and

such
as
the

to
short

,
often
'
prove
the
rule
'
that
the
corticosterone
response
helps
an
individual
survive
threats
according
to
ecological
context
and
life

trade
-
offs
.

Thus
,
for
conservation
purposes
,
comparing
corticosterone
levels
in
birds
exposed
to
different
environmental
conditions
,
and
measuring
the
corticosterone
response
to
suspected
threats
or
disturbances
,
may
be
useful
ways
to
identify
threats
to
bird
populations
.

We
report
several
recent
studies
of
disturbance
and
corticosterone
in
Golden
-
cheeked
Warblers
and
Black
-

Vireos
,
endangered
insectivorous
passerines
breeding
in
central
Texas
(

degrees

For
comparison
with
a
common
and
widespread
species
with
similar
ecology
,
we
also
studied
White
-
eyed
Vireos
.

We
measured
corticosterone
in
relation
to
naturalistic
threats
and
anthropogenic
disturbances
directed
at
adults
and
their
offspring
over
multiple
time
scales
.

Many
of
our
results
contradict
similar
experiments
in
other
birds
.

We
interpret
these
differences
in
relation
to
ecology
,
life
history
,
and
the
conservation
of
birds
.

The

seems
to
have

Finally

TAPACULOS
(

Scytalopus
(
Rhinocryptidae

is
one
of
the
most
challenging
avian
genera
from
a
systematics
perspective
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
genus
is
an
excellent
model
for
studies
on
diversification
and
biogeography
in
the
Neotropical
montane
region
as
a
result
of
its
wide
distribution
,
high
species

,
and
low

ability
.

We
reconstructed
a
molecular
phylogeny
for
the
genus
and
close
relatives
based
on
mitochondrial
and
nuclear
DNA
sequences
,
sampling
most
of

,
and
multiple

for
species
thought

Our
results
allow
us
to
assess
the
monophyly
of
Scytalopus
with
respect
to
closely

and
highlight
the
existence
of
multiple
highly

Analyses
of
the

indicate
a

INFLUENCES
OF
SALVAGE
LOGGING
AFTER
FIRE

ON
FOREST
BIRDS
IN
THE
EASTERN
CASCADES
,
OREGON
Fire
is
an
important
component
of
a
disturbance
regime
that
structures
the
vegetative
structure
and
composition
of
species
in
coniferous
forests
of
western
North
America
.

Yet
,
the
impact
of
post
-
fire
management
on
the
wildlife
of
these
forests
is
not
well
known
.

We
compared
relative
abundances
and
densities
of
forest
birds
in
unsalvaged
stands
and
stands
subjected
to
one
of
two
intensities
of
salvage
logging
(
moderate
,
30
snags
retained
/
ha
and
heavy
,
5
-
6
snags
retained
/
ha
)
in
mixed
-
conifer
forests
in
central
Oregon
.

We
used
analysis
of
variance
with
repeated
measures
to
evaluate
three
hypotheses
concerning
the
influence
of
different
intensities
of
salvage
logging
on
relative
abundances
or
densities
of
16
species
of
birds
.

We
detected
significant
differences
in
densities
or
relative
abundances
of
seven
species
among
treatments
,
though
the
patterns
of
differences
varied
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
both
cavity
-
nesting
and
non
-
cavity
nesting
species
respond
to
salvage
logging
,
and
that
some
species
respond
uniquely
to
habitat
features
potentially
influenced
by
salvage
logging
.

For
species
that
responded
negatively
to
salvage
logging
,
the
moderate
salvage
intensity
did
not
mitigate
the
negative
influence
of
salvage
logging
.

MORPHOLOGICAL

CORRELATES
OF
DIGIT

IN
THE
DARK
-
EYED
JUNCO

The
hormonal
environment
a
bird
experiences
during
development
can
have
long
-
term
effects
on
its
behavior
,
morphology
and
physiology
.

Studies
of
mammals
,
including
humans
,
have
found
a
negative
relationship
between
testosterone
(
T
)
exposure
in
utero
and
digit
length
ratio
(
DR
possibly
due
to
the
co
-
regulatory
roles
of
specific
homeobox
genes
on
both
digit
and
uro
-
genital
development
.

These
homeobox
genes
are
highly
conserved
,
predicting
that
gonad
function
and
DR
may
also
co
-
vary
in
birds
.

We
examined
correlations
between
DR
and

in
male

(

by
the
ability
of
the
testes
to
respond
to
gonadotropin

(
GnRH
)
with
an

in
T.
Preliminary
results
revealed
an
association
:
males
with
lower
DR
exhibited
greater
elevation
in
T
,
as
the
literature
on
mammals
would
predict
.

In
contrast
,
higher

was
associated
with
greater

KING
VULTURE
’S
HABITAT
REQUIREMENTS
IN
THE
SOUTHERN
YUCATAN

The
King
Vulture
Sarcoramphus
papa
is
a
dweller
of
the
tropical
forests
of
America
,
from
Mexico
to
Argentina
.

This
large
bird
seems
to
be
declining
throughout
its
range
,
although
the
reasons
are
unclear
.

In
this
study
we
explored
the
relationships
between
several
environmental
variables
a
priori
important
to
the
King
Vulture
and
the
permanence
of
roosts
,
at
various
spatial
scales
.

We
found
that
roosts
used
for
several
years
,
even
decades
,
had
characteristics
that
distinguished
them
from
roosts
used
occasionally
and
roosts
abandoned
at
least
for
two
years
.

The
permanent
roosts
were
located
at
the
edge
of
permanent
watercourses
,
presented
features
such
as
fallen
trees
serving
as
perch
over
the
water
,
and
the
roosts
themselves
were
emergent
trees
of
larger
dimensions
than
surrounding
trees
.

At
all
the
studied
scales
(
from
0.5
to
16
km
the
presence
of
permanent
roosts
was
also
linked
to
the
presence
of
large
amount
of
mature
forest
78

In
fact
,
there
was
a
strong
negative
relationship
between
roost
permanence
and
all
the
variables
reflecting
anthropogenic
disturbance
,
such
as
secondary
forests
,
crops
,
pastures
,
and
bare
areas
.

Our
results
suggest
that
the
high
number
of
king
vultures
supported
by
the
Southern
Yucatan
is
due
to
the
large
amount
of
mature
forest
remaining
in
the
area
,
as
well
as
the
availability
of
sites
with
permanent
watercourse
.

However
,
these
sites
are
extremely
rare
in
the
region
,
and
are
sought
by
rural
populations
for
their
own
water
supply
,
which
may
pose
a
threat
in
the
future
.

THE
INFLUENCE
OF
AMBIENT
TEMPERATURE

HORNED
LARK

INCUBATION
BEHAVIOR
IN
AN
ALPINE
ENVIRONMENT
Incubation
is
an
energetically
costly
activity
for
birds
,
particularly
in
alpine
environments
where
ambient
temperatures
vary
more
than
30oC
daily
and
parents
must
both
warm
and
cool
their
eggs
.

Incubating
parents
must
tradeoff
between
their
foraging
requirements
and
the
thermal
needs
of
the
eggs
;
even
small
deviations
in
egg
temperature
impact
normal
embryo
development
.

We
measured
incubation
rhythms
in
Horned
Larks
breeding
in
alpine
habitat
in
British
Columbia
and
found
quadratic
relationships
between
ambient
temperature
and
the
total
time
spent
incubating
,
the
frequency
of
recesses
,
and
bout
duration
.

Females
spent
less
total
time
on
the
nest
as
ambient
temperature
increased
to
12
-
13oC
;
at
higher
temperatures
the
relationship
was
reversed
.

Females
adjusted
the
amount
of
time
spent
incubating
by
varying
the
frequency
of
recesses
rather
than
recess
durations
,
which
lasted
8
-
10
minutes
and
were
not
affected
by
ambient
temperature
.

Alpine
horned
larks
appear
to
modify
their
incubation
rhythms
to
minimize
the
cost
of
rewarming
and
cooling
eggs
,
while
simultaneously
minimizing
the
risk
of
predation
and
chilling
or
overheating
the
eggs
.

CONSERVING
PLAYA
WETLANDS

AS
MIGRATORY
STOPOVER
HABITAT
FOR
SHOREBIRDS
AND
WATERFOWL
Playas
,
the
most
numerous
wetlands
in
the
southern
and
central
Great
Plains
,
provide
critical
migratory
stopover
habitat
for
wetlanddependent
birds
.

Because
playas
become
wet
only
after
unpredictable
heavy
rainfall
events
,
they
are
difficult
to
map
,
and
data
regarding
their
location
,
condition
,
and
status
are
lacking
.

Distributed
primarily
in
farmland
,
playas
are
threatened
by
sedimentation
.

Conservation
programs
have
recently
been
implemented
but
their
effects
on
bird
use
have
not
been
described
.

Using
rainfall
data
,
aerial
flights
,
and
field
surveys
,
we
studied
playas
in
western
Nebraska
and
eastern
Colorado
to
describe
hydrology
,
habitat
characteristics
,
and
use
by
wetland
-
dependent
birds
.

We
confirmed
playas
in
approximately
75
%
of
the
locations
predicted
by
GIS
models
;
frequencies
in
cropland
,
grassland
,
and
conservation
programs
varied
by
state
.

Our
data
suggest
that
with
similar
rainfall
,
playas
occurring
in
USDA
Conservation
Reserve
Program
fields
were
less
likely
to
become
wet
than
playas
in
grassland
or
cropland
.

Playas
provided
appropriate
water
depths
and
annual
plants
for
foraging
waterfowl
and
shorebirds
.

Waterfowl
and

increased
with

the

pointing
to
a

may
harbor

Coalescentbased

We
also
found
that
nine

greater

indicating
that
although

there

In

.

While
such
differences
might
reflect
stopover

quality
for
individual

,
these
differences
might
also
be
explained
by
the
differential
occurrence
of
breeding

individuals
of
certain

between

.

Capture

were
broadly
comparable
between

but
several
notable
differences
emerged
.

In

,
a
lower
proportion
of
birds
at
the

were
captured
in
the

I
will

as
well
as

MOLECULAR
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
BREEDING
SYSTEM
IN
THE
UPLAND
SANDPIPER

In
birds
,
the
offspring
of
females
in
socially
monogamous
species
are
often
sired
not
only
by
their
social
mate
(
within
-
pair
mating
)
but
also
by
other
males
(
extra
-
pair
mating
resulting
in
broods
of
mixed
paternity
.

The
majority
of
studies
on
extra
-
pair
paternity
(
EPP
)
have
been
done
on
songbirds
,
and
the
other
lineages
of
birds
have
received
less
attention
.

Our
objective
was
to
determine
the
genetic
mating
system
of
the
Upland
Sandpiper
(
Bartramia
longicauda
a
threatened
grassland
shorebird
.

The
breeding
ecology
of
Upland
Sandpipers
is
poorly
known
but
we
have
been
conducting
a
population
study
of
this
species
at
Konza
Prairie
Biological
Station
in
northeast
Kansas
.

In
the
course
of
a
7-year
project
,
225
nests
have
been
monitored
and
786
sandpipers
have
been
marked
with
color
bands
(
n
468
adults
,
n
318
young
Mated
pairs
usually
raise
one
clutch
of
4
eggs
per
season
,
both
sexes
incubate
,
and
males
are
responsible
for
parental
care
after
hatching
.

Like
many
socially
monogamous
avian
species
,
Upland
Sandpiper
pairs
are
thought
to
mate
exclusively
with
each
other
,
but
we
observed
evidence
suggesting
that
their
mating
system
may
be
more
complex
:
color
-
marked
birds
have
been
observed
switching
mates
within
a
breeding
season
,
two
nests
have
been
attended
by
social
groups
other
than
a
mated
pair
(
e.g
two
females
,
three
incubating
birds
and
one
nest
contained
five
eggs
.

We
used
6
microsatellite
markers
to
test
for
the
existence
of
EPP
in
58
family
groups
of
sandpipers
(
n
107
parents
,
n
184
offspring
We
found
overall
rates
of
EPP
to
be
low
in
this
population
of
Upland
Sandpipers
.

We
are
currently
testing
whether
EPP
is
positively
correlated
with
degree
of
relatedness
between
mated
pairs
and
nesting
density
.

DOES
CULTURAL
DIVERGENCE
PLAY
A
ROLE
IN
GENETIC
DIVERGENCE
?

A
TEST
IN
A
TROPICAL
BIRD
.

Among
some
allopatric
bird
populations
,
songs
drift
into
different
dialects
,
which
upon
secondary
contact
may
serve
as
an
isolating
mechanism
due
to
a
lack
of
recognition
.

As
song
is
learned
,
this
could
represent
a
behavioral
mechanism
whereby
a
culturally
transmitted
trait
affects
the
genetic
structure
of
populations
.

We
examined
female
song
recognition
of
dialects
in
two
allopatric
populations
of
Rufous
-
collared
Sparrows
lt;em&gt;Zonotrichia
capensis&lt;/em&gt
in
Ecuador
.

These
populations
,
which
are
25
km
apart
but
separated
by
the
Andes
Mountains
,
exhibit
asynchronous
reproductive
phenology
,
genetic
differentiation
,
and
different
male
song
dialects
.

We
quantified
female
responsiveness
to
male
song
,
using
a
copulation
solicitation
assay
.

In
playback
experiments
,
we
exposed
females
to
the
following
song
types
:
local
dialect
,
non
-
local
dialect
(
25
km
away
distant
non
-
local
dialect
(
4000
km
away
and
a
control
song
from
a
local
bird
.

Females
solicited
more
often
to
local
song
than
to
the
other
stimuli
.

This
preference
for
the
local
song
dialect
suggests
that
cultural
divergence
could
lead
to
reproductive
isolation
,
population
divergence
and
subsequent
speciation
.

CONCENTRATION
AND
EFFECTS
OF
SELENIUM
ON

SHOREBIRDS
AT
GREAT
SALT
LAKE
,
UTAH

The
Great
Salt
Lake
(
GSL
)
is
well
known
as
an
important
shorebird
site
and
is
recognized
as
a
WHSRN
site
of
hemispheric
importance
.

A
recent
proposal
to
dispose
of
reverse
osmosis
concentrate
within
the
GSL
has
led
to
concern
over
potential
selenium
(
Se
)
contamination
.

Selenium
is
a
toxic
trace
element
that
may
disrupt
avian
development
,
and
increase
mortality
.

Consequently
,
we
examined
the
ambient
concentrations
of
Se
within
water
,
sediment
and
macroinvertebrates
samples
collected
at
three
sites
within
the
GSL
.

These
data
were
compared
to
the
concentrations
found
within
blood
,
liver
and
eggs
of
American
Avocets
(
Recurvirostra
americana
)
and
Black
-
necked
Stilts
(
Himantopus
mexicanus
Tissue
Se
concentrations
were
above
suggested
thresholds
of
toxicity
and
higher
than
expected
given
concentrations
found
within
ambient
samples
.

However
,
Se
concentrations
were
not
elevated
in
eggs
,
and
hatchability
was
high
,
ranging
from
0.94
to
1.0
.

Studies
are
currently
being
conducted
to
examine
the
apparent
discrepancy
in
results
.

New
samples
are
being
analyzed
for
both
mercury
and
Se
to
test
the
hypothesis
that
a
possible
interaction
between
these
toxins
may
increase
bioaccumulation
and
retention
of
Se
.

REPRODUCTIVE
AGE
AND
TELOMERE

LENGTH
IN
MAGELLANIC
PENGUINS
(
SPHENISCUS
MAGELLANICUS
)

Physiological
systems
deteriorate
as
a
result
of
aging
in
most
species
.

Senescence
is
the
decline
of
these
physiological
systems
with
age
.

Under
life
-
history
theory
,
long
-
living
species
should
invest
more
in
maintenance
systems
like
immune
function
,
as
these
are
likely
to
be
key
factors
in
adult
survival
.

Magellanic
penguins
(
Spheniscus
Magellanicus
)
live
more
than
30
years
in
the
wild
.

Life
history
theory
predicts
that
penguins
should
favor
maintenance
over
immediate
reproduction
,
as
longevity
leads
to
more
reproductive
events
.

Telomeres
are
the
tandem
repeating
non
-
coding
sequences
that
protect
the
coding
regions
of
the
DNA
,
during
cell
replication
.

In
long
-
lived
species
,
telomeres
shorten
more
slowly
than
in
short
-
lived
species
,
however
the
life
-
history
decisions
that
drive
the
shortening
of
telomeres
is
poorly
known
.

We
examined
the
telomere
lengths
and
telomere
rate
of
change
for
98
known
age
Magellanic
penguins
to
determine
whether
telomeres
shorten
more
rapidly
in
individuals
that
reproduce
more
frequently
.

We
also
examined
whether
the
body
condition
of
younger
and
older
penguins
differed
and
whether
telomere
length
was
longer
in
birds
of
the
same
age
that
were
in
better
condition
.

at
a

To

taken

THE

DIVERSIFICATION
Diversification
of

thus
,
this

and
test
what

NEST
SIZE
AND
CLUTCH
SIZE
IN
BARN
SWALLOWS
:

AN
EXPERIMENT
Nest
size
is
a
potential
proximate
constraint
on
clutch
size
in
birds
.

While
secondary
cavity
nesters
are
often
constrained
by
the
size
of
cavities
they
occupy
,
Barn
Swallow
nest
size
may
be
constrained
by
the
structural
demands
of
a
mud
nest
built
on
a
vertical
wall
.

To
assess
whether
nest
size
places
a
proximate
constraint
on
barn
swallow
clutch
size
,
we
compared
the
clutch
size
in
spring
and
summer
nests
of
Barn
Swallows
breeding
in
artificial
cups
with
drastically
different
volumes
(
140
ml
vs.
330
ml
)
at
a
colony
in
NC
in
2008
.

Because
of
strong
site
fidelity
and
a
history
of
artificial
nest
cup
use
in
this
population
,
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
swallows
using
large
vs.
small
cups
varied
in
quality
.

THE
EFFECT
OF
NEST
PREDATION
AND
FORAGING
BEHAVIOR

ON
DIFFERENTIAL
GROWTH
OF
PASSERINES
Nest
predation
has
been
suggested
as
a
strong
selective
pressure
that
favors
faster
growth
rates
and
shorter
nestling
periods
in
altricial
birds
.

In
addition
,
predation
may
also
favor
species
that
prioritize
the
growth
and
development
of
components
that
are
crucial
for
leaving
the
nests
.

We
predicted
that
a
)
species
with
higher
nest
predation
rates
will
preferentially
grow
their
tarsus
relative
to
other
morphological
traits
,
and
b
)
that
they
will
develop
endothermy
earlier
than
species
with
lower
predation
rates
.

Meanwhile
,
ground
foragers
may
especially
emphasize
their
growth
on
tarsus
.

We
tested
the
effect
of
nest
predation
and
foraging
behavior
by
measuring
body
mass
,
tarsus
and
wing
chord
length
and
development
of
endothermy
in
10
species
of
passerines
with
different
nest
predation
rates
in
a
high
elevation
riparian
forest
in
northern
Arizona
.

We
found
that
nestlings
of
species
with
higher
predation
rates
left
the
nest
earlier
and
completed
tarsus
growth
and
developed
endothermy
at
a
relatively
smaller
body
size
and
shorter
wing
chord
.

Our
study
suggests
that
variation
in
growth
strategy
among
altricial
passerine
species
may
be
partly
explained
by
predation
pressure
.

TOWARD

A
COMPLETE
PHYLOGENY
OF
THE
FURNARIIDAE

A
primary
characteristic
of
the
Neotropical
avifauna
is
the
species
-
richness
of
its
endemic
groups
,
and
one
of
the
most
diverse
of
these
is
the
family
Furnariidae
,
the
ovenbirds
and
woodcreepers
.

Because
many
furnariids
exhibit
what
appear
to
be
highly
derived
conditions
of
behavior
,
ecology
,
or
morphology
,
relationships
have
been
largely
unresolved
by
traditional
methodology
,
and
previous
molecular
studies
of
the
group
have
used
incomplete
sampling
of
the
family
.

As
a
step
toward
a
complete
species
-
level
phylogeny
of
the
Furnariidae
,
we
used
a
combination
of
mitochondrial
,
nuclear
intron
,
and
nuclear
exon
sequence
to
determine
monophyly
of
and
relationships
among
all
genera
of
furnariids
.

Features
of
the
furnariid
tree
,
as
well
as
aspects
of
biogeography
and
the
evolution
of
nesting
in
this
group
,
will
be
discussed
.

The
role
of
gene
expression
variation
in
adaptation
and
acclimation
to
environmental
stress
is
largely
unexplored
in
natural
populations
of
birds
.

High
altitude
habitats
expose
individuals
to
hypoxic
and
thermal
stress
that
should
induce
changes
in
gene
expression
.

We
used
a
zebra
finch
(
Taeniopygia
guttata
)
cDNA
microarray
to
assay
transcriptomic
profiles
of
Zonotrichia
capensis
populations
distributed
along
an
elevational
gradient
on
the
Pacific
slope
of
the
Peruvian
Andes
.

Over
two
hundred
genes
involved
in
metabolic
pathways
were
differentially
expressed
between
high
(
4100
m
)
and
low
(
2000
m
)
elevation
populations
.

To
assess
plasticity
in
gene
expression
profiles
,
we
performed
a
"
common
garden
"
experiment
in
which
high
and
low
elevation
individuals
were
transferred
to
a
common
low
altitude
site

100
m
None
of
the
genes
that
were
differentially
expressed
in
the
native
altitudes
were
significantly
different
in
comparisons
between
individuals
in
the
common
garden
.

These
results
illustrate
a
high
level
of
phenotypic
plasticity
in
the
transcriptomic
profiles
of
Z.
capensis
that
may
contribute
to
the
broad
elevational
distribution
of
the
species
.

A
PRIMER
ON
RECORDING
FIELD
DATA
,
WITH
AN
EMPHASIS
ON
GOOD
VERSUS

BAD
LOCALITIES

The
recording
of
high
quality
field
data
is
critical
when
collecting
specimens
for
scientific
study
.

Such
data
provide
information
about
the
distribution
,
ecology
,
and
behavior
of
species
,
and
enable
researchers
to
use
specimens
in
ways
that
were
unforeseen
at
the
time
of
collection
.

Furthermore
,
because
of
increasing
permit
restrictions
,
each
specimen
and
its
associated
data
become
more
valuable
.

Although
the
specifics
of
recording
field
data
vary
across
institutions
and
researchers
(
e.g
data
sheets
versus
free
-
form
catalog
and
journal
basic
standards
of
data
collection
apply
.

This
includes
metadata
about
the
individual
(
e.g
age
,
molt
,

when
it
was

THE
SIGNIFICANCE
OF
SUBSPECIES
:

A
CASE
STUDY
OF
SAGE
SPARROWS
(
AMPHISPIZA
BELLI
)

The
utility
of
subspecies
has
been
hotly
debated
among
North
American
ornithologists
.

This
contention
stems
from
the
fact
that
many
avian
subspecies
were
described
in
the
late
1800s
-
early
1900s
with
relatively
few
specimens
and
characters
compared
to
modern
standards
,
and
molecular
analyses
often
don&#8217;t
corroborate
boundaries
defined
using
traditional
methods
.

While
such
results
are
not
surprising
,
this
incongruence
has
led
some
to
attack
the
subspecies
concept
.

Nonetheless
,
subspecies
8211
;
if
defined
as
phenotypically
diagnosable
,
discrete
breeding
populations
8211
;
can
be
significant
because
they
(
1
)
provide
evidence
of
early
stages
of
allopatric
speciation
2
)
provide
evidence
of
local
adaptation
in
spite
of
ongoing
gene
flow
3
)
alert
researchers
to
differences
other
than
traits
originally
considered
,
leading
to
recognition
of
some
subspecies
as
full
species
;
and
(
4
)
inform
researchers
about
non
-
breeding
movements
of
distinct
portions
of
species&#8217
;
breeding
ranges
.

The
Sage
Sparrow
(
Amphispiza
belli
)
provides
an
excellent
case
study
because
relationships
at
both
subspecies
and
species
levels
have
been
debated
for
110
years
.

I
review
ongoing
,
detailed
studies
of
A.
belli
populations
and
discuss
whether
subspecies
have
hindered
or
helped
our
understanding
.

LINKING
PHYOGEOGRAPHY
AND
DISTRIBUTIONAL
ECOLOGY
Until
recently
,
studies
of
the
distributional
ecology
of
species
were
hindered
by
limited
access
to
large
data
sets
with
written
descriptions
of
localities
.

Fortunately
,
advances
in
biodiversity
informatics
notably
the
development
of
distributed
data
networks
such
as
ORNIS
(
http
ornisnet.org
)
have
greatly
facilitated
such
research
.

These
networks
provide
a
single
portal
for
querying
masses
of
data
from
multiple
institutions
and
apply
standardized
georeferencing
methods
to
localities
for
spatial
analysis
.

The
increasing
availability
of
tools
for
modeling
species
distributions
in
a
phylogeographic
framework
is
especially
exciting
,
because
it
allows
explicit
study
of
ecogeographic
patterns
of
molecular
and
morphological
variation
.

We
use
the
Steller
's
Jay
(
Cyanocitta
stelleri
an
excellent
candidate
,
to
explore
these
tools
.

It
is
strongly
polytypic
,
well
-
represented
in
museum
collections
(
and
thus
in
ORNIS
and
was
recently
the
subject
of
a
broad

scale
phylogeographic
study
(

2007
We
used
over

from
ORNIS
and
developed
ecological
niche
models
of
the
species

for
comparison
with
phylogeographic

are

A
NEW
TEST
USING
MORPHOMETRIC
DIVERSITY

Although
the
Furnariidae
has
been
regarded
as
one
of
the
most
spectacular
examples
of
a
continental
adaptive
radiation
,
this
assertions
as
never
been
put
to
rigorous
test
.

Here
I
present
the
first
quantitative
study
of
the
morphometric
diversity
of
furnariids
.

I
compared
furnariids
with
six
other
Neotropical
families
in
the
superfamily
Furnarioidea
using
eleven
measures
of
the
external
anatomy
.

I
developed
a
new
multivariate
measure
of
morphometric
diversity
that
takes
covariation
into
account
.

Then
,
I
used
a
linear
regression
model
that
incorporates
information
on
time
of
divergence
,
as
estimated
by
molecular
dating
,
and
species
richness
of
each
family
to
test
whether
the
morphometric
diversity
of
Furnariidae
is
unusually
high
.

I
found
that
Furnariidae
is
not
unusually
diverse
in
size
,
but
it
is
significantly
more
diverse
in
shape
.

This
represents
the
first
quantitative
test
of
the
high
ecomorphological
diversity
of
Furnariidae
,
and
evidence
that
they
represents
an
authentic
continental
adaptive
radiation
.

CONVERGENT
ACOUSTIC
MECHANISMS
IN
CALYPTE
HUMMINGBIRDS

The
Anna
's
Hummingbird
(

uses
two
mechanisms
to
produce
sound
:

it
sings
vocal
songs
from
perches
,
and
produces
a
loud
dive
-
sound
with
its
tail
feathers
.

Its
congener
,
the
Costa
's
Hummingbird
(
Calypte
costae
sings
vocal
songs
from
perches
and
produces
a
dive
-
sound
as
well
.

Acoustically
,
the
Costa
's
song
and
dive
-
sound
are
virtually
indistinguishable
from
each
other
.

I
assess
evidence
indicating
that
the
Costa
's
dive
-
sound
is
also
tail
-
generated
,
and
suggest
that
this
species
has
convergently
evolved
two
mechanisms
to
produce
the
same
signal

investigated
the

Songs

,
and

.

In
addition
,
feeders
were
placed
in
the
territories
of
17
randomly
selected
males
.

Song
recordings
obtained
from
these
males
over
the
entire
breeding
season
were
compared
with
a
reference
group
of
14
males
and
plasticity
of
song
over
the

was
determined
.

Heavier
birds
and
those
with
longer

earlier
.

Males
that
sang
more
frequently
acquired

and
earlier

while
the

predators
and
better
fed
hosts
can
be
expected
to
devote
more
time
to
anti

brood
-
parasite
behaviour
.

For
their
part
,
brood
parasites
should
prefer
to
parasitize
better
fed
hosts
because
their
nestlings
will
both
be
better
provisioned
,
and
be
less
likely
to
be
eaten
by
a
predator
given
that
better
fed
host
parents
can
be
expected
to
devote
more
time
to
anti
-
predator
behaviour
.

We
show
that
,
despite
being
better
at
avoiding
nest
predation
,
food
supplemented
song
sparrows
suffer
more
brood
parasitism
by
brown
-
headed
cowbirds
and
,
in
some
respects
,
suffer
more
when
parasitized
.

Our
results
are
consistent
with
cowbirds
preferentially
parasitizing
better
fed
hosts
and
we
present
direct
evidence
that
better
fed
hosts
clearly
provide
the
cowbird
with
a
better
resource
base
.

Our
work
adds
to
a
growing
number
of
studies
demonstrating
that
food
-
host
-
parasite
interactions
are
more
complex
than
once
thought
.

In

However
,
environmental
factors

influence
a

rate
has
been
inversely

VIREOS
DURING
SPRING
STOPOVER
Stopover
periods
during
migration
provide
an
ideal
setting
for
studies
about
resource
selection
because
migrants
are
typically
landing
in
novel
landscapes
when
they
are
energetically
constrained
and
temporally
restricted
by
the
benefits
of
arriving
early
to
breeding
sites
.

We
conducted
a
translocation
experiment
to
determine
if
migrants
select
habitat
types
varying
in
arthropod
abundance
and
how
energetic
condition
affects
selection
.

During
spring
migration
of
2007
fifteen
radio

vireos
lt;em&gt;Vireo
olivaceus&lt;/em&gt
were
released
into
in
an
unfamiliar
landscape
and
tracked
daily
until
signals
were
lost
.

All
of
the
birds
released
in
the
low
and
intermediate
quality
habitat
types
left
them
and
moved
into
higher
quality
habitat
types
.

The
birds
released
in
the
highest
quality
habitat
all
remained
in
that
habitat
except
one
which
moved
into
the
intermediate
quality
habitat
.

Birds
released
in
low
quality
habitat
displaced
longer
linear
distances
on
the
day
of
release
than
birds
released
in
either
intermediate
or
high
quality
habitat
.

The
results
of
this
experiment
will
be
used
to
create
a
behavioral

based
model
of
how
habitat

context
affect
the

Recent

suggests
that
the

can
have
profound
impacts
on
the
evolution
of
song
structure
,
which
in
turn
might
promote

Specifically
,
deeper
bills
should
be
accompanied
by
songs
of
larger

Although
basic

we
found
dramatic
differences
across
a
suite

,
for

Playback

revealed
that

whereas
males
in

respond
equally
to
both
local

.

Our
results
suggest
that
geographic
variation

could
contribute
to
divergence
in
a
unidirectional
manner
,
potentially
reducing

Island
bird
populations
are
at
a
higher
risk
of

than
mainland
populations
,
and
island
endemics
may
have
a
higher
risk
still
.

The
Island
Scrub

,
found
on
Santa
Cruz
island
off
the
coast
of
California
,
is
the
only
insular
endemic
bird
found
in
the
continental
United
States
.

In
2000
,
population
estimates
indicated
the
species
was
relatively
abundant
,
but
recent
field
studies
suggest
a
drastic
decline
.

We
conducted
a
preliminary
population
viability
analysis
by
combining
field
data
collected
over
a
thirty
year
period
.

We
designed
the
model
to
identify
the
risks
of
extinction
due
to
habitat
loss
and
disease
epidemics
.

The
results
indicated
the
population
would
decline
as
habitat
availability
decreased
,
but
the
risk
of
extinction
was
minimal
within
50
years
.

Chronic
disease
models
identified
the
possibility
of
extinction
within
50
years
,
as
did
catastrophic
disease
models
though
to
a
lesser
degree
.

Our
results
,
though
preliminary
,
may
help
to
identify
and
manage
threats
to
this
species
and
thereby
lower
the
risk
of
extinction
.

ECOLOGY

CERULEAN
WARBLER
IN
THE
NORTHERN
ANDES
:

NEW
INSIGHTS
Recent
population
declines
have
prompted
the
International
Union
for
the
Conservation
of
Nature
to
list
Cerulean
Warbler
em

Dendroica
cerulea</em
Parulidae
)
as
a
Vulnerable
species
.

In
response
,
members
of
El
Grupo
Ceruleo
,
a
subcommittee
of
the
Cerulean
Warbler
Technical
Group
that
addresses
wintering
ground
issues
faced
by
the
species
,
developed
a
predictive
model
of
wintering
habitat
for
Cerulean
Warblers
throughout
the
northern
Andes
.

From
2006
-
2008
,
we
conducted
field
surveys
in
Colombia
,
Ecuador
and
Venezuela
as
part
of
efforts
to
validate
the
winter
habitat
model
.

In
this
poster
presentation
,
we
overview
recent
analyses
about
the
suitability
of
the
habitat
model
to
predict
wintering
range
as
well
as
share
new
insights
into
the
distribution
and
ecology
of
Cerulean
Warblers
.

First
,
our
data
show
that
Cerulean
Warblers
occupy
a
broader
altitudinal
range
than
previously
thought
.

Second
,
wintering
Ceruleans
utilize
a
wider
variety
of
habitat
types
,
including
different
successional
stages
and
intensively
-
managed
agroecosystems
.

Third
,
the
species
shows
a
strong
association
with
neotropical
mixed
species
flocks
mostly
composed
by
resident
species
.

Collectively
,
these
findings
have
important
implications
for
conservation
efforts
in
the
Northern
Andes

Intermittent

must
balance

Mean

depends
on
three

of

recess
cycle
:
egg
cooling
during
recesses
,
and
egg

and

We

the
influence

on
the

-
offs
between
mean

and

within

.

We
used
an

as
a

of

to
compute
the
range
of
possible

for

DEPENDENT
AGE
AT

FIRST
REPRODUCTION
IN
THE
EASTERN
KINGBIRD

Delayed
breeding
is
not
expected
among
relatively
short
-
lived
species
such
as
migratory
passerines
,
but
few
data
exist
to
evaluate
this
expectation
.

Here
we
quantify
age
at
first
reproduction
in
an
eastern
kingbird
population
.

Through
both
observational
and
experimental
approaches
,
we
investigate
the
potential
causes
for
the
high
frequency
of
delayed
breeding
that
occurs
in
this
population
.

Nearly
half
of
the
fledged
nestlings
that
returned
to
the
breeding
grounds
did
not
breed
in
their
first
potential
breeding
season
.

Some
non
-
breeders
occupied
territories
,
for
at
least
some
period
,
but
most
remained
as
non
-
territorial
"
floaters
Parentage
analysis
failed
to
show
any
reproductive
success
for
female
floaters
,
and
only
limited
success
for
male
floaters
,
indicating
that
floating
was
not
a
successful
reproductive
tactic
.

On
the
other
hand
,
a
strong
negative
relationship
existed
between
population
size
and
the
proportion
of
young
birds
that
bred
in
their
first
year
,
and
floaters
of
both
sexes
quickly
filled
territorial
vacancies
created
by
experimental
adult
removals
.

Limited
breeding
habitat
and
territorial
behavior
of
older
birds
thus
appears
to
be
the
main
cause
of
delayed
breeding
in
kingbirds
.

FOOD
SUPPLY
AND
SOCIAL
ENVIRONMENT
AFFECT
MIGRATORY
BEHAVIOR
AND
PHYSIOLOGY
IN
AN
IRRUPTIVE
NOMAD
,
THE
RED
CROSSBILL

Many
animals
make
seasonal
migrations
to
exploit
predictable
but
temporary
food
sources
,
and
usually
rely
on
endogenous
programs
and
seasonal
changes
in
photoperiod
to
appropriately
time
such
movements
.

Alternatively
,
facultative
migrations
(
e.g.
irruptions
)
typically
occur
in
response
to
an
unpredictable
decline
in
the
local
food
supply
.

One
hypothesis
is
that
local
,
immediate
environmental
cues
(
e.g.
food
supply
,
social
cues
)
induce
facultative
migrations
.

We
experimentally
evaluated
this
hypothesis
,
as
well
as
the
potential
role
for
stress
hormones
in
mediating
the
behavioral
transition
into
an
irruptive
state
.

We
studied
captive
red
crossbills
em
>

Loxia
curvirostra</em
an
irruptive
,
nomadic
bird
that
specializes
on
conifer
seeds
,
to
determine
if
a
decline
in
food
availability
and/or
social
cues
affect
behavior
and
glucocorticoid
levels
.

Experimental
birds
that
were
food
restricted
to
75
%
of
normal
daily
food
intake
for
72
hours
significantly
increased
activity
and
baseline
corticosterone
levels
.

Further
,
these
behavioral
and
physiological
responses
were
enhanced
or
attenuated
,
depending
on
the
food
supply
conditions
of
a
neighbor
.

These
results
implicate
circulating
glucocorticoids
as
well
as
food
cues
and
public
information
in
the
regulation
of
facultative
migration
.

INDIVIDUAL
RECOGNITION
OF
PEOPLE
BY
AMERICAN
CROWS

We
experimentally
investigated
the
anecdotal
evidence
that
the
American
Crow
em
>

Corvus
brachyrhynchos</em
can
recognize
individual
people
.

We
captured
,
banded
,
and
released
crows
at
four
study
sites
along
a
gradient
of
human
density
around
Seattle
,
WA
while
wearing
a
realistic
human
mask
and
later
assessed
the
response
of
crows
to
this
and
five
other
similar
masks
.

We
captured
crows
at
each
site
(
N=
15
,
13
,
6
,
5
)
while
wearing
one
of
the
masks
and
an
armband
.

A
different
mask
was
used
as
the
"
trapping
mask
"
at
each
site
.

Ten
naïve
observers
at
each
site
walked
a
specified
route
and
recorded
the
responses
received
from
the
crows
.

Crows
that
scolded
or
mobbed
a
masked
observer
were
considered
to
have
recognized
it
.

We
found
a
significant
increase
in
the
scolding
of
masks
from
pre
to
post
-
trapping
.

There
was
no
significant
difference
between
mask
only
and
masks
with
armbands
,
suggesting
that
the
facial
region
is
what
the
crows
focus
on
.

Birds
that
were
not
captured
by
masked
trappers
participated
in
scolding
.

Discrimination
among
masks
was
imperfect
,
but
suggestive
of
recognition
of
human
facial
qualities

PENINSULA
.

Were
analyzed
the
geographical

for
the
resident

birds
of
the
Yucatan
Peninsula
,
using
point
records
data
obtained
in
more
than
70
scientific
collections
and
data
sets
,
and
scientific
literature
.

Biogeographic
similarity
between
the
bird
component
was
examined
using
a
phenetic
distance
index
,
and
we
estimated
the
possible
number
of
species
distributed
in
the
Peninsula
.

We
recorded
the
presence
of
474
species
(
528
estimated
)
with
the
information
of
the
database
.

Five
species
are
endemic
to
Mexico
and
17
to
the
Yucatan
Peninsula
.

Mexican
endemics
are
mainly
restricted
to
Cozumel
Island
and
in
the
northwestern
portion
of
the
Peninsula
,
in
drier
areas
with
tropical
dry
forest
.

Peninsular
endemic
species
are
found
in
the
southeastern
wetter
portion
along
with
tropical
non

deciduous
forest
.

Similarity
analysis
led
to
the
recognition
of
two
main
areas
with
different
bird
component
,
one
in
the
northwestern
portion
and
the
other
in

COMPLIMENTARY

ANALYSES
Studies
comparing
dispersal
in
fragmented

unfragmented
landscapes
have
shown
that
habitat
fragmentation
alters
the
dispersal
behavior
of
many
species
.

We
explored
how
Florida

(
FSJ

effective

changes
as
a
function
of
the
amount
of
available

and
the

that
separate

by
comparing

.

Gene

However

greater

The
combination
of
these

that
while
FSJs
disperse
longer
distances
as

increases
,
they
are
less
likely

In

investigate
how

Specifically
,
we

determining
which

better
predict
both
the

to
investigate
which

Our

indicate
that
the

both
the

DEVELOPMENT
OF
CAMERA
TECHNOLOGY
FOR
MONITORING
NESTS
.

The
technology
used
to
monitor
bird
nests
has
developed
rapidly
since
its
introduction
.

Early
systems
,
which
consisted
of
35
mm
film
cameras
and
manual
triggers
used
with
artificial
nests
,
progressed
to
digital
cameras
with
motion
sensing
triggers
that
could
be
used
with
real
nests
.

The
development
of
portable
time
-
lapse
video
technology
and
covert
infrared
light
sources
was
significant
and
allowed
for
constant
surveillance
of
real
avian
nests
for
extended
periods
of
time
.

Until
recently
,
most
continuously
recording
video
systems
utilized
an
analog
recorder
(
e.g.
VCR
but
new
advances
in
digital
technology
coupled
with
an
increase
in
flash
memory
storage
capacity
have
made
digital
video
systems
a
practical
alternative
to
analog
technologies
.

We
present
the
components
of
an
inexpensive

)
user
-
built
digital
camera
system
.

We
discuss
the
merits
of
digital
and
analog
technologies
and
consider
the
costs
and
benefits
of
user
-
built
systems
compared
to
those
manufactured
by
vendors
.

We
also
explore
other
uses
of
video
for
avian
ecologists
and
discuss
new
technological
advances
relevant
to
nest
monitoring
systems
.

LIFETIME
REPRODUCTIVE
SUCCESS
IN
MERCURY
-
CONTAMINATED
TREE
SWALLOWS

It
has
proved
difficult
to
link
contaminants
with
specific
fitness
effects
in
free
-
living
birds
,
because
such
effects
may
be
subtle
,
often
have
a
long
lag
time
,
and
are
subject
to
influences
from
confounding
factors
.

At
mercury
-
contaminated
sites
in
Virginia
,
we
measured
survival
and
reproductive
success
in
a
large
population
of
Tree
Swallows
from
2005
-
2008
.

Birds
nesting
on
mercurycontaminated
sites
exhibited
significantly
lower
reproductive
success
and
survival
than
those
at
reference
sites
in
the
same
watershed
,
but
this
lowered
fitness
was
detectable
only
after
two
years
of
exposure
.

Females
nesting
at
a
contaminated
site
for
two
years
produced
approximately
one
less
fledgling
each
year
,
and
were
only
half
as
likely
to
return
the
following
year
,
relative
to
reference
females
.

There
appeared
to
be
a
dose
-
dependent
relationship
between
lifetime
production
of
fledglings
and
individual
blood
mercury
level
,
which
,
if
robust
,
would
be
one
of
the
first
direct
demonstrations
that
a
specific
contaminant
impacted
a
direct
measure
of
fitness
in
a
wild

SINGING
IN

BROWN
CREEPER
EM

MOHOUA
NOVAESEELANDIAE</EM

AND
IT
'S
FUNCTION

IN
TERRITORIAL
DEFENSE

The
New
Zealand
Brown
Creeper
has
a
unique
form
of
male
/
male
vocal
interaction
which
I
have
called
unison
singing
.

Unlike
vocal
interactions
in
other
species
Creeper
males
temporally
overlap
their
songs
during
unison
singing
,
sounding
like
one
male
singing
loudly
.

In
order
to
determine
if
male
Creepers
adjusted
their
singing
performances
when
interacting
with
each
other
and
to
see
if
these
adjustments
related
to
the
probability
that
the
contestants
would
behave
agonistically
towards
one
another

I
examined
complete
recordings
of
interactions
for
four
possible
adjustments
in
singing
behavior
.

These
adjustments
were
1
)
altering
the
number
of
songs
overlapped
2
)
varying
time
delay
between
the
first
(
leader
)
and
second

)
male
's

3
)
preference
of
males
of
being
either
a
leader
or
follower
and
(
4
)
males
showing
a
preference
of
truncating
their
songs
during
interactions
.

Males
did
show
adjustments
that
appear
to
relate
to
the
probability
of
them
behaving
agonistically
towards
one
another
.

It
appears
that
males
use
these
adjustments
to
communicate
with
each
other
during
the
process
of
bargaining
when
they
are
defining
their
territorial
boundaries
.

EXACTLY

WHAT
ARE
INTERIOR
SPECIES
?

Anthropogenic
landscape
change
has
increased
the
importance
of
understanding
which
species
are
most
vulnerable
to
habitat
fragmentation
Interior
species
"
designate
those
species
that
avoid
edges
,
but
the
term
has
been
defined
and
used
inconsistently
.

Conservation
planning
requires
objective
approaches
to
identifying
interior
species
and
comparing
degrees
of
interior
habitat
requirements
.

For
woodland
species
breeding
in
a
mixed
open
-
forest
site
in
North
Dakota
,
we
determined
degrees
of
interior
habitat
requirements
by
plotting
probability
of
occurrence
,
based
on
field
observations
,
against
gradients
of
habitat
availability
.

Incidence
plots
identified
thresholds
,
asymptotes
,
and
peaks
in
habitat
selection
.

For
example
,
some
species
required
at
least
20
-
40
percent
tree
cover
in
the
landscape
,
others
increased
up
to
30
-
40
percent
tree
cover
and
were
unaffected
by
additional
tree
cover
,
and
yet
others
were
most
common
with
intermediate
levels
of
tree
cover
.

These
plots
allow
clearer
descriptions
of
habitat
preferences
,
which
aids
in
comparing
habitat
use
at
contrasting
scales
and
in
contrasting
environments
.

This
approach
can
facilitate
conservation
efforts
by
identifying
species
-
specific
habitat
requirements
with
greater
accuracy
than
previous
approaches
.

Environmental
change
can
affect
both
disease
prevalence
and
transmission
between
vectors
and
hosts
.

However
,
the
ecological
factors
responsible
for
modifying
host
/
parasite
relationships
are
not
always
clear
.

Understanding
these
relationships
is
important
considering
the
recent
outbreaks
of
diseases
that
threaten
both
bird
and
human
populations
,
such
as
avian
influenza
.

To
date
most
of
the
avian
influenza
surveillance
has
focused
on
water
birds
,
which
represent
a
small
percentage
of
avian
diversity
.

Here
we
examine
the
role
that
passerines
play
in
the
spread
of
AIV
along
migratory
pathways
in
North
America
,
and
describe
sensitive
high
-
throughput
methods
for
detecting
influenza
.

After
screening
thousands
of
passerines
from
North
America
we
find
a
prevalence
positive
rate
of
4
however
,
the
highly
pathogenic
strain
H5
N1
has
not

detected
.

We
describe
approaches
for
mapping
avian
influenza
strains
,
migratory
route
and
human
associated
influenza
strains
using
satellite
remote
sensing
and
bioclimatic
variables
.

These
data
will
be
used
to
assess
the
natural
transmission
routes
of
AIV
between
wild
birds
and
humans
,
and
predict
the
effects
that
anthropogenic
environmental
change
will
have
on
the
transmission
dynamics

GLUCOCORTICOIDS
AS
INDICATORS
OF
STRESS
All
animals
must
cope
with
unpredictable
environmental
stressors
.

A
key
component
of
the
vertebrate
stress
response
is
the
secretion
of
steroid
hormones
called
glucocorticoids
from
the
adrenal
cortex
.

Elevated
glucocorticoid
concentrations
facilitate
survival
of
short
-
term
stress
,
but
chronically
elevated
glucocorticoids
are
physiologically
harmful
.

Since
glucocorticoid
concentrations
are
related
directly
to
health
,
glucocorticoids
are
a
promising
physiological
measure
of
animal
health
.

Using
laboratory
and
field
studies
,
we
investigated
the
glucocorticoid
response
to
experimentally
induced
chronic
unpredictable
stress
in
European
starlings
em
>

Sturnus
vulgaris</em

In
free
-
living
starlings
,
chronic
stress
reduced
both
plasma
glucocorticoid
concentrations
and
reproductive
success
indicating
a
physiological
and
fitness
cost
to
stress
in
free
-
living
animals
.

In
contrast
,
glucocorticoids
measured
in
fecal
samples
were
higher
in
free
-
living
chronically
stressed
starlings
compared
to
unstressed
controls
.

Chronic
stress
in
captive
starlings
attenuated
plasma
glucocorticoid
concentrations
supporting
field
results
,
but
did
not
alter
fecal
glucocorticoid
concentrations
.

Overall
,
chronic
stress
changed
glucocorticoid
concentrations
,
but
the
direction
of
that
change
depended
on
sample
type
(
plasma
or
fecal
Consequently
,
more
research
is
needed
before
glucocorticoid
concentrations
can
be
used
as
a
reliable
physiological
indicator
of
animal
health

PHYSIOLOGICAL
CHANGES
AND
LOCALIZATION
OF
AVIAN
UCP
IN
SKELETAL
MUSCLE
Skeletal
muscle

is
the
primary
site
of
thermogenesis
in
birds
.

Both
shivering
and
locomotion
are
dependent
upon
efficient
ATP
production
.

The
recent
discovery
of
an
avian
uncoupling
protein
(
avUCP
a
homologue
of
UCP1
in
mammalian
BAT
,
suggests
that
avian
muscle
may
also
be
capable
of
regulatory
non
-
shivering
thermogenesis
(
NST
Like
UCP1
,
avUCP
may
be
upregulated
after
cold
-
acclimation
.

Because
low
ATP
production
would
be
counterproductive
during
contraction
,
avUCP
may
be
differentially
expressed
in
subsarcolemmal
mitochondria
(
SSM
)
relative
to
intermyofibrillar
mitochondria
(
IFM
)
near
contracting
myofibrils
.

Alternatively
,
avUCP
may
play
a
supportive
role
during
high
catabolic
flux
by
preventing
redox
imbalances
and/or
oxidative
damage
in
mitochondria
.

We
acclimated
2
-
5
wk
old
Japanese
Quail
to
warm
(
25C
)
or
cold
(
5C
)
and
(
1
)
probed
the
presence
of
avUCP
mRNA
and
(
2
)
assessed
avUCP
protein
in
SSM
and
IFM
isolates
from
pectoralis
muscles
.

Avian
UCP
mRNA
was
present
in
all
quail
,
but
avUCP
protein
was
present
only
in
IFM
in
both
acclimation
groups
,
with
slightly
higher
levels
after
cold
-
acclimation
.

Localization
of
avUCP
to
IFM
suggests
a
supportive
role
during
high
catabolic
flux

western
Amazonia
through
a
case
study
in

We
used
mist

to
sample

at
12
study
sites
in
unlogged
forests
and
forests
regenerating
between
1
and
10
years
after
selective

.

Canopy

was
significantly
reduced
in
logged
forests
.

We
detected
a
total
of
54
bird
species
in
16
taxonomic
families
.

We
assumed
not
all
species
were
detected
and
used
sampling

to
generate
estimates
of
bird

and
local
extinction
and

DELAYED

OF
JUVENILE

MOURNING
DOVES

We
examined
the
effects
of
conditions
during
early
development
25
old
)
on
flight
ability
of
juvenile
mourning
doves
em

Zenaida
macruoura</em
n
48
)
from
25
to
90
d
of
age
.

Developmental
conditions
were
manipulated
during
two
stages
,
the
nestling
period
and
post
-
fledging
,
using
a
full
factorial
design
.

During
the
nestling
stage
we
manipulated
clutch
size
in
nests
to
create
1
,
2
,
and
3
nestling
clutches
.

Prior
to
fledging
,
birds
were
brought
to
an
aviary
and
provided
food
at
either
low
,
medium
,
or
high
quantities
until
age
25
d
,
and
then
provided
food
ad
libitum
.

Flight
ability
was
measured
as
the
time
it
took
birds
to
flush
and
fly
1.5
m
when
startled
from
a
perch
at
ages
25
,
35
,
and
90
d.

No
difference
occurred
among
treatments
at
25
and
35
d.

At
90
d
,
flight
time
was
negatively
related
to
clutch
size
and
differed
among
feeding
treatments
with
the
slowest
times
for
birds
in
the
low
treatment
.

Results
indicate
that
nutritional
stress
during
development
may
have
effects
on
flight
ability
that
appear
after
growth
is
completed
.

BIRD
CONSERVATION
THROUGH
THE
SCIENCE
OF
COMMUNICATIONS
AND
EDUCATION
Achievement
of
bird
conservation
goals
depends
on
the
actions
of
people
.

These
actions
,
such
as
incorporation
of
conservation
objectives
into
land
management
plans
or
restoration
of
habitat
on
agricultural
lands
,
relies
on
effective
communication
and
education
techniques
.

Success
in
this
arena
must
be
grounded
in
the
same
rigorous
planning
,
implementation
and
evaluation
processes
as
is
bird
conservation
science
Audiences
"
are
like
"
species
"
as
we
prioritize
,
research
,
monitor
,
and
ultimately
evaluate
our
effectiveness
.

We
will
review
this
often
overlooked
process
and
the
relevant
social
science
literature
.

A
case
study
from
Playa
Lakes
Joint
Venture
will
provide
an
illustration
of
potential
conservation
success
.

Given
that
education
professionals
are
skilled
in
following
this
process
for
effective
communication
and
education
,
we
will
discuss
how
we
might
better
harness
educators
'
efforts
to
lead
in
achieving
the
array
of
goals
in
bird
conservation
.

The
recently
developed
and
growing
Bird

Alliance
for
Conservation
offers
great
new
potential
for
such
collaboration

SEASONAL
DECLINE
IN
AVIAN
CLUTCH
SIZE
:

A
TEST
OF
FOUR
ALTERNATIVE
HYPOTHESES
To
maximize
fitness
potential
,
birds
breeding
in
highly
seasonal
environments
must
time
reproductive
events
and
adjust
reproductive
effort
to
minimize
costs
from
weather
,
predation
,
and
food
limitation
.

Given
that
clutch
size
generally
decreases
with
season
,
theory
predicts
that
the
costs
of
reproduction
must
increase
seasonally
.

Despite
more
than
50
years
of
investigation
into
the
patterns
and
processes
underlying
clutch
size
in
birds
,
we
know
relatively
little
about
how
seasonal
conditions
interact
to
influence
reproductive
timing
and
reproductive
effort
.

To
address
this
question
we
simultaneously
tested
four
longstanding
hypotheses
explaining
seasonal
declines
in
avian
clutch
size
:
1
)
nest
predation
,
2
)
food
availability
for
laying
females
,
3
)
food
availability
for
nestlings
,
and
4
)
individual
quality
.

Preliminary
results
suggest
support
for
the
predation
and
individual
quality
hypotheses
.

COMPOSTIONAL
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
LEFT
AND
RIGHT
TESTES
IN
CHUKAR
IN
RELATION
TO
SPERM
PRODUCTION
AND
SIDE
-
BIAS
IN
COPULATION
.

Most
birds
exhibit
asymmetrical
reproductive
tracts
characterized
by
a
single
,
left
-
side
ovary
and
oviduct
or
larger
left
testis
relative
to
the
right
.

Recent
behavioral
studies
have
demonstrated
left
-
side
bias
in
copulation
in
at
least
8
bird
species
,
including
Chukar
em
>

Alectoris
chukar</em

We
hypothesized
that
enlarged
left
testes
in
male
birds
represents
a
left
-
side
specialization
in
sperm
production
.

We
compared
left
versus
right
testes
of
Chukar
for
size
,
mass
,
abundance
of
testosterone
-
producing
Leydig
cells
,
and
abundance
of
spermatids
.

Left
and
right
testes
differ
significantly
in
composition
.

The
left
testis
is
larger
and
more
massive
than
the
right
.

Leydig
cells
occur
at
lower
density
within
the
left
testis
but
at
equal
total
numbers
between
testes
,
consistent
with
the
endocrine
action
of
Leydig
cells
.

Left
testes
exhibit
a
greater
density
of
spermatids
per
area
than
do
right
testes
.

Greater
spermatid
density
coupled
with
greater
size
of
left
testes
results
in
substantially
greater
left
-
side
sperm
production
relative
to
the
right
.

Testicular
asymmetry
in
birds
may
result
from
cryptic
sexual
selection
for
left
-
side
sperm
production
independent
of
any
selection
for
androgen
production
.

AUTOMATED
DETECTION
OF

NOCTURNAL
FLIGHT
CALLS
:

A
COMPARISON
OF
ANALYTICAL

SOFTWARE
Bioacoustic
analysis
of
nocturnal
flight
calls
has
great
potential
for
monitoring
avian
migration
.

Recent
advances
in
computer
software
have
made
automated
detection
of
flight
calls
within
an
audio
stream
much
more
practical
.

By
comparing
the
functionality
of
several
sound
analysis
programs
we
identified
important
issues
to
consider
when
employing
automated
software
.

Newer
programs
such
as
XBAT
and
Raven
contain
a
number
of
improvements
over
traditional
software
such
as
Tseep
-
X
,
notably
parameters
which
adjust
the
ratios
of
detections
vs.
true
calls
.

When
compared
to
manually
sorted
audio
files
,
adjustable
software
consistently
outperformed
Tseep
-
X
in
both
accuracy
and
efficiency
.

We
were
able
to
customize
detectors
with
a
94
%
detection
rate
as
well
as
detectors
that
balanced
slightly
lower
detection
rates
with
better
true
/
false
ratios
.

When
using
adjustable
detectors
,
we
found
significant
differences
in
function
of
parameter
settings
under
site
specific
conditions
leading
us
to
conclude
that
settings
should
be
considered
on
a
site
by
site
basis
.

Assessing
accuracy
and
efficiency
under
a
variety
of
conditions
is
an
important
step
in
standardizing
collection
and
analysis
of
flight
call
data
.

EFFECTS
OF
RECREATIONAL
HIKING
TRAILS
ON
MONTANE
BIRD
OCCUPANCY
AND
DETECTABILITY
Several
bird
species
inhabiting
high
elevation
forests
of
northeastern
North
America
have
experienced
significant
population
declines
over
the
past
15
years
.

Efforts
to
identify
potential
causes
of
these
declines
and
to
validate
existing
trail
-
based
survey
methods
have
become
increasingly
important
.

We
used
occupancy
models
to
test
the
hypothesis
that
recreational
trails
have
no
effect
on
the
occupancy
and
detectability
of
birds
in
high
elevation
spruce
-
fir
forests
of
northeastern
North
America
.

We
surveyed
montane
birds
at
113
locations
in
the
White
Mountains
,
NH
in
2006
and
2007
.

Surveys
were
repeated
three
times
per
year
and
were
divided
between
locations
on
the
trail
,
at
200
m
and
400
m
from
the
trail
.

In
contrast
to
previous
studies
,
we
found
that
hiking
traffic
did
not
have
a
negative
effect
on
the
montane
bird
community
in
the
White
Mountains
.

Our
findings
indicate
that
inferences
made
by
trailbased
monitoring
programs
are
not
limited
to
trail
-
side
habitat
and
may
be
more
reflective
of
the
entire
montane
spruce

forest
in
northeastern
North

TRANSITIONAL
WING
HYPOTHESIS
AND
THE
EVOLUTION
OF
AVIAN
FLIGHT

The
evolution
of
avian
flight
remains
one
of
biology
's
major
controversies
with
a
long
history
of
functional
interpretations
of
fossil
forms
as
evidence
for
either
an
arboreal
or
cursorial
origin
of
flight
.

Despite
repeated
emphasis
on
the
wing
-
stroke
as
a
necessary
avenue
of
investigation
for
addressing
the
evolution
of
flight
no
empirical
data
exist
on
wing
-
stroke
dynamics
in
an
experimental
evolutionary
context
.

Here
we
present
the
first
comparison
of
wing
-
stroke
kinematics
of
the
primary
locomotor
modes
(
descending
flight
and
incline
flap
-
running
)
requiring
forelimb
use
exhibited
by
juvenile
ground
birds
throughout
development
and
offer
results
that
are
contrary
to
both
popular
perception
and
inferences
from
other
studies
.

Commencing
shortly
after
hatching
and
continuing
through
adulthood
,
ground
birds
employ
a
nearly
invariant
wing
-
stroke
of
&
lt;20&#176
when
referenced
to
gravitational
alignment
,
that
directs
aerodynamic
forces
~40&#176
;
above
horizontal
,
despite
a
&
gt;180&#176
;
range
in
the
direction
of
travel
.

Based
on
our
results
,
we
put
forth
an
Ontogenetic
-
Transitional
Wing
Hypothesis
which
posits
that
the
incremental
adaptive
stages
leading
to
the
evolution
of
avian
flight
correspond
behaviourally
and
morphologically
to
transitional
stages
observed
in
ontogenetic
forms
.

EVALUATING
THE
EFFECTS
OF
TRANSLOCATION
ON
THE
AVIAN
STRESS
RESPONSE
Translocation
,
an
important
conservation
tool
for
rescuing
declining
avian
species
,
has
a
high
rate
of
failure
.

This
study
investigates
a
potential
cause
of
translocation
failure
:
chronic
stress
.

Using
chukar
(
Alectoris
chukar
)
to
simulate
translocation
,
samples
were
taken
upon
capture
in
the
wild
or
during
ten
-
day
captivity
.

Sampling
in
the
wild
occurred
upon
initial
capture
of
an
individual
or
upon
recapture
.

The
three
recapture
groups
underwent
:

1
)
capture
,
release
;
2
)
capture
,
captivity
,
home
territory
release
;
and
3
)
capture
,
captivity
,
unfamiliar
territory
release
.

Alterations
in
the
hypothalamic
-
pituitary
-
adrenal
(
HPA
)
axis
,
which
stimulates
corticosterone
(
CORT
were
determined
with
a
series
of
blood
samples
.

CORT
concentrations
were
determined
at
baseline
,
following
restraint
stress
,
after
negative
feedback
initiated
by
Dexamethasone
injection
,
and
following
ACTH
stimulation
.

Captivity
altered
HPA
function
after
five
days
but
function
was
regained
by
9
days
.

In
the
wild
,
capture
and
release
did
not
alter
HPA
function
compared
to
naïve
birds
,
but
capture
and
captivity
decreased
the
CORT
response
to
restraint
and
to
negative
feedback
.

Translocation
,
therefore
,
appears
to
cause
chronic
stress
as
indicated
by
alterations
of
the
stress
physiology
of
translocated
individuals
.

NEST

HATCHING
FAILURE
,
AND
CHICK
CONDITION
IN
A
SOUTHEASTERN
POPULATION
OF
TREE
SWALLOWS

In
recent
decades
,
Tree
Swallows
have
expanded
their
range
into
the
Southeast
US
.

In
order
to
assess
how
these
northerly
birds
fare
at
the
extreme
southeastern
edge
of
their
breeding
range
,
we
compared
rates
of
total
hatching
failure
,
hatching
success
,
and
chick
condition
in
dark
(
hot
)
and
light
(
cool
)
nestboxes
over
the
course
of
four
breeding
seasons
in
the
southern
piedmont
of
NC
.

Because
relatively
few
swallows
attempted
summer
nests
,
our
samples
are
biased
toward
the
cooler
portion
of
the
breeding
season
.

However
,
our
results
indicate
that
birds
using
dark
boxes
later
in
the
breeding
season
suffer
more
than
do
those
in
lighter
boxes
nesting
at
the
same
time
.

This
suggests
that
high
temperatures
do
act
as
a
constraint
on
Tree
Swallow
reproductive
success
at
the
southeastern
edge
of
their
breeding
range
.

Sociality
and
dispersal
interact
in
complex
ways
such
that
social
species
are
often
assumed
to
exhibit
unique
dispersal
strategies
.

Dispersal
is
also
influenced
by
landscape
structure
,
with
habitat
fragmentation
frequently
resulting
in
altered
dispersal
patterns
.

Yet
little
is
known
about
potential
three
-
way
interactions
between
sociality
,
dispersal
,
and
landscape
structure
.

We
compared
social
behavior
and
natal
dispersal
behavior
in
the
non

social

throated
treecreeper
em
>

Cormobates
leucophaeus</em
and
the
cooperatively

brown
treecreeper
em

Climacteris
picumnus</em

We
also
compared
social
and
dispersal
behavior
in
brown
treecreepers
living
in
one
continuous
and
two
fragmented
landscapes
that
differed
in
the
degree
and
type
of
structural
connectivity
between
patches
.

We
found
that
while
the
two
species
exhibited
a
similar
repertoire
of
dispersal
behaviors
in
continuous
habitat
,
individuals
in
the
social
species
adjusted
both
their
social
behavior
and
their
dispersal
tactics
to
cope
with
habitat
fragmentation
.

Our
results
suggest
that
plasticity
in
dispersal
behavior
may
make
it
easier
to
reconnect
fragmented
habitats
,
and
plasticity
in
social
behavior
may
help
buffer
social
species
against
at
least
some
of
the
negative
effects
of
fragmentation
.

APPLICATION

As
part
of

"

we
will
discuss
the
reverse

methods
to
estimating
population

and
associated
demographic
parameters
.

We
will
briefly
explain
the
methods
and
examine
the
history
of
adoption
of
these
methods
in
avian
systems
.

We
will
utilize
these
methods
with
a
>
15

-
Jay
em

data
set
.

This
jay
lives
only
on
Santa
Cruz
Island
,
located
off
the
coast
of
southern
California
.

Concerns
about
anecdotal
declines
in
this
species
exist
.

We
test
hypotheses
about
whether
population
declines
are
evident
,
and
which
demographic
parameters
might
be
most
closely
associated
with
a
population
decline
.

We
also
assess
mechanistic
explanations
(
e.g
disease
introduction
,
habitat
modifications
associated
with
swine
removal
)
for
possible
changes
in
demographic
rates
.

We
find
evidence
for
a
chronic
population
decline
that
is
associated
with
declines
in
jay
survival
.

We
make
study
design
recommendations
to
address
future
data
needs
for
the

GROWTH

'S
PIPIT
NESTLINGS
IN
NATIVE

GRASSLAND
Sprague
's
Pipits
em
>

Anthus
spragueii</em
occur
most
commonly
on
large
parcels
of
native
mixed
-
grass
prairie
.

In
some
regions
,
pipits
breed
in
planted
grasslands
but
it
is
unknown
if
these
anthropogenic
habitats
are
ecological
sinks
.

We
quantified
nestling
growth
rates
in
native
and
planted
sites
in
south
-
central
Saskatchewan
,
Canada
to
determine
whether
nestlings
from
native
grassland
had
higher
growth
rates
than
those
in
planted
grassland
.

Predation
rates
of
grassland
passerine
nests
are
typically
higher
than
those
of
other
avian
guilds
,
thus
selection
should
favour
species
that
maximize
growth
and
development
to
minimize
time
spent
in
the
nest
.

We
predicted
nestling
growth
rates
to
be
greater
in
native
grassland
because
of
increased
diversity
and
abundance
of
high
quality
prey
.

We
measured
mass
and
tarsus
length
of
nestlings
from
39
nests
during
2006
and
2007
.

Based
on
logistic
growth
curves
,
we
found
that
nestlings
in
planted
grassland
grew
at
a
similar
rate
as
nestlings
in
native
grassland
.

We
suggest
that
planted
grassland
is
important
for
pipit
reproduction
and
must
be
considered
with
native
grassland
in
conservation
plans
for
this
and
other
grassland
songbird
species

We
used

to
estimate
the

of

in
adult

.

While
adult
body
mass
and
wing
length
(
at
the
age
of
one
year
)
were
significantly
heritable
,
juvenile
body
mass
and
wing
length
(
at
the
age
of
9
days
)
were
not
heritable
,
and
neither
was

Similarly
,
the
size
of
first
-
year
females
'
second
clutch
was
significantly
heritable
while
their
first
clutch
was
not
.

These
results
suggest
that
traits
expressed
early
in
development
,
such
as
nestlings
'
morphology
or
the
clutch
size
of
young
females
may
be
less
heritable
than
traits
expressed
later
in
life
.

This
may
be
due
to
their
greater
sensitivity
to
environmental
conditions
and/or
due
to
temporal
variations
in

THE
EVOLUTION
OF
FEMALE
PLUMAGE
COLOURATION
Studies
of
sexual
selection
have
traditionally
focused
on
male
ornaments
.

In
many
species
,
however
,
females
also
display
elaborate
traits
.

Elaborate
female
traits
may
occur
as
a
result
of
genetic
correlation
with
male
traits
.

Alternatively
,
elaborate
female
traits
may
evolve
by
sexual
or
social
selection
.

The
goal
of
our
study
was
to
evaluate
multiple
factors
that
might
influence
the
evolution
of
female
plumage
patterns
across
various
bird
species
.

We
collected
plumage
reflectance
data
from
127
New
World
species
.

To
obtain
a
measure
of
female
conspicuousness
,
we
calculated
the
Euclidean
distance
between
plumage
reflectance
and
background
vegetation
reflectance
.

We
then
compared
these
scores
to
various
ecological
and
life
history
variables
.

Female
plumage
was
more
cryptic
in
species
using
open
-
cup
nests
than
closed
nests
,
and
for
species
nesting
at
heights
known
to
have
higher
predation
risks
.

Additionally
,
when
males
invest
more
in
offspring
by
nest
building
,
incubating
,
or
feeding
offspring
,
females
are
significantly
more
conspicuous
.

Our
findings
emphasize
the
important
influence
of
predation
risk
and
parental
investment
on
the
evolution
of
female
plumage
coloration
and
suggest
that
natural
and
sexual
selection
interact
to
shape
plumage
traits
in
females
.

We
analyzed

from
approximately
50
Burmese
Pythons
captured
in
Everglades
National
Park
to
determine
the
avian
diet
of
this

.

Because
most
of
the
prey
items
were
heavily
digested
,
a
variety
of
trace

identification
techniques
were
employed
to
identify
the
bird
species
ingested
.

This
paper
presents
the
methods
for
the
cleaning
and
identification
of
fragmentary
avian
bone
and
feather
and
describes
the
procedure
for
identifying
birds
from
microscopic
feather
evidence
.

Many
different
species
of
birds
were
identified
in
this
study
,
some
of
which
are
listed
as
threatened
in
the
state
of
Florida
.

Using
forensic
methods
to
identify
prey
remains
of
invasive
species
can
help
justify
species
depredation
and
underscores
the
importance
of
controlling
non

that
affect

There
are
benefits

However
,

I

even
though

MOUNTAIN
PLOVERS
AND
THE
POLITICS
OF
RESEARCH
ON
PRIVATE
LANDS

The
critical
role
of
private
lands
in
the
conservation
of
threatened
and
endangered
species
has
been
well
documented
.

Although
researchers
and
policymakers
recognize
the
need
to
include
private
lands
in
conservation
planning
,
they
often
falter
over
the
question
of
how
to
do
so
.

The
current
literature
contains
only
a
few
research
studies
on
species
of
conservation
concern
on
private
lands
.

We
describe
our
experiences
with
a
partnership
-
based
approach
with
private
landowners
to
conduct
research
on
the
mountain
plover
(
Charadrius
montanus
a
species
that
was
proposed
for
listing
under
the
US
Endangered
Species
Act
.

In
our
approach
,
research
is
an
objective
tool
that
is
accessible
to
all
partners
involved
,
and
researchers
do
not
take
a
lead
role
in
the
resolution
of
sociopolitical
issues
.

We
provide
guidelines
for
conducting
studies
on
private
land
,
with
the
goal
of
improving
researchers
'
interactions
with
private
landowners
.

PULSED
RESOURCES
AND
THE
REGULATION
OF
SPECIES
RICHNESS
:

AVIAN
COMMUNITY
DYNAMICS
DURING
A
MOUNTAIN
PINE
BEETLE
OUTBREAK
Species
richness
is
thought
to
be
regulated
within
narrow
bounds
only
under
conditions
of
constant
resource
supply
.

Resource
pulses
represent
episodes
of
heightened
but
ephemeral
resource
availability
,
and
provide
an
opportunity
to
examine
regulation
of
richness
in
the
face
of
a
major
ecological
perturbation
.

We
examined
the
response
of
bird
communities
,
categorized
into
six
foraging
guilds
,
to
a
large
-
scale
outbreak
of
mountain
pine
bark
beetles
in
British
Columbia
,
Canada
,
1997
-
2007
.

Density
and
richness
of
bark
insectivores
increased
over
the
course
of
the
outbreak
,
whereas
densities
of
most
other
foraging
guilds
did
not
.

As
predicted
,
richness
of
bark
insectivores
showed
no
evidence
of
regulation
,
although
most
foraging
guilds
displayed
only
weak
evidence
of
regulation
of
richness
.

These
results
provide
mixed
support
for
the
role
of
constant
resource
availability
on
the
regulation
of
richness
.

We
suggest
weak
regulation
of
richness
may
be
a
general
feature
of
forest
bird
communities
.

BEHAVIORAL
SHIFTS
AND
DIVERSIFICATION
RATE
IN
STARLINGS
AND
THRUSHES
Closely
related
clades
of
birds
often
strongly
differ
in
species
richness
a
pattern
that
is
ultimately
due
to
differences
in
speciation
and
extinction
rates
among
clades
.

Species
that
specialize
on
a
limited
resource
should
have
lower
diversification
rates
because
competition
for
this
resource
can
limit
ecological
opportunity
and
may
increase
rates
of
taxa
extinction
.

Here
,
we
compare
speciation
and
extinction
rates
among
taxa
of
the
Muscicapidae
that
differ
in
nest
site
use
.

We
show
that
taxa
that
are
strictly
limited
to
nesting
in
tree
cavities
have
higher
rates
of
extinction
compared
to
taxa
that
are
more
flexible
in
nest
site
use
.

Speciation
rates
did
not
differ
among
these
groups
.

These
results
suggest
that
intense
competition
for
nest
sites
among
obligate
secondary
cavity
nesting
species
may
increase
rates
of
extinction
.

More
generally
,
these
results
emphasize
the
importance
of
investigating
traits
that
limit
diversification
to
understand
overall
patterns
of
species
richness
.

The
Variable
Pitohui
(
Pitohui

is
a
common
and
widespread
lowland
bird
species
endemic
to
New
Guinea
.

With
20
currently
-
recognized
subspecies
distributed
in
an
area
approximately
the
size
of
Texas
,
the
Variable
Pitohui
has
been
one
of
New

's
most
perplexing
and
subdivided
bird
species
.

Here
,
mitochondrial
and

are
used
to
understand
gene

and
phylogenetic
patterns
,
and
the
geographic

of

patterns
is
used
to
examine
ecological
selection
.

Neither
phylogeography
nor
plumage
pattern
alone
can
adequately
describe
the
subspecies
.

Some
subspecies
appear
to
have
diverged
rapidly
despite
lack
of
reciprocal
monophyly
in
mtDNA
(
ecological
subspecies
while
others
appear
to
have
been
isolated
historically
and
have
achieved
reciprocal

Both
patterns
are
evolutionarily
relevant
and
significant
although
there
is
a
growing
focus
and
reliance
on
reciprocal
monophyly
as
a
criterion
for
evolutionary
significance
.

Historically
for
birds
,
subspecies
have
been
morphologically
distinguishable

and
this

AVIFAUNA

:

HOTSPOT
OR
NOT
?

The
Gaoligongshan
Mountains
(
GLGS
)
form
the
south
eastern
extent
of
the
Himalaya
Mountains
.

The
GLGS
consists
of
a
narrow
north
-
south
running
range
that
rises
over
4000
m
in
the
north
and
disappears
into
the
lowlands
in
south
,
and
the
range
is
defined
by
the
Irrawaddy
lowlands
to
the
west
and
by
the
Nujiang
(
AKA
Salween
River
)
to
the
east
.

Here
,
we
summarize
results
of
five
ornithological
expeditions
that
surveyed
rough
altitudinal
transects
in
the
southern
and
northern
GLGS
.

The
GLGS
is
a
designated
UNESCO
World
Heritage
Site
and
is
considered
a
8220;Hotspot&quot
;
by
multiple
conservation
organizations
.

We
use
bird
distributions
to
examine
whether
the
GLGS
qualifies
as
a
avian
hotspot
.

Although
the
GLGS
has
tremendous
avian
diversity
,
there
is
relatively
little
endemism
and
many
GLGS
taxa
are
near
the
extreme
of
their
range
.

There
is
little
evidence
that
the
GLGS
has
been
a
center
for
avian
evolution
and
diversification
,
however
it
appears
to
be
an
important
continental
region
with
significant
avian
diversity
.

It
may
have
been
and
is
likely
to
remain
an
important
and
precious
refuge
for
montane
forest
birds

suggests
that

We
conducted

as
well
as

By

critical

can

leading

PARASITIZED
BROWN
PELICAN
NESTLINGS
HAVE
INCREASED
RATES
OF
GROWTH
AT
SUBLETHAL
LEVELS
OF
INFESTATION

The
soft
tick
Carios
capensis
is
a
common
nest
parasite
in
colonies
of
Brown
Pelicans
.

Our
goal
was
to
determine
the
effect
of
tick
parasitism
on
nestling
growth
at
sublethal
levels
of
infestation
.

We
examined
the
rate
of
increase
for
body
mass
and
culmen
length
during
the
linear
phase
of
nestling
growth
in
relation
to
four
tick
loads
(
none
,
low
,
moderate
,
high
We
monitored
48
nests
at
two
colonies
in
South
Carolina
for
two
consecutive
breeding
seasons
.

Levels
of
parasitism
differed
between
colonies
but
not
between
years
.

Nestling
growth
rates
did
not
differ
among
tick
loads
at
the
less
infested
colony
,
or
among
low
,
moderate
,
or
high
tick
loads
at
the
more
infested
colony
.

Parasitized
nestlings
at
the
latter
colony
had
or
tended
to
have
significantly
higher
rates
of
growth
for
body
mass
and
culmen
length
compared
to
nestlings
with
no
ticks
.

These
results
suggest
the
presence
of
underlying
behavioral
modifications
or
physiological
adaptations
in
pelicans
that
prevent
the
typical
negative
or
null
effect
of
ectoparasites
on
growth
.

EARLY
EXPOSURE
AND
LATE
EFFECTS
OF
CONTAMINANTS
IN
BIRDS
WITH
A
RECENT
EXAMPLE
OF
FIELD
EXPOSURE
TO
DDT
AND
ITS
IMPACT
ON
THE
BRAIN

There
are
increasing
reports
in
the
mammalian
literature
that
in
utero
or
lactational
exposure
to
a
variety
of
environmental
contaminants
has
serious
consequences
for
neuroendocrine
and
sexual
development
.

Strong
evidence
is
lacking
for
birds
,
in
part
due
to
a
dearth
of
experimental
studies
.

There
are
some
recent
reports
from
field
and
lab
studies
linking
in
ovo
exposure
to
organochlorines
with
avian
reproductive
outcome
and
eggshell
quality
.

We
studied
American
robins
exposed
to
legacy
DDT
in
an
orchard
environment
by
collecting
nestlings
which
had
been
exposed
in
ovo
and
keeping
them
in
pens
through
two
reproductive
cycles
.

Those
two
-
year
old
birds
had
small
brains
with
smaller
relative
forebrain
volumes
.

There
were
significant
reductions
in
size
of
two
song
nuclei
,
Robustus
Arcopallialis
and
the
Higher
Vocal
Centre
,
and
in
a
structure
critical
for
normal
sexual
behaviour
,
Nucleus
Intercollicularis
.

The
mechanism
is
likely
via
androgen
receptor
antagonism
,
probably
by
the
primary
metabolite
DDE
.

Results
were
corroborated
by
correlations
between
the
various
neurological
parameters
and
exposure
to
DDT
compounds
via
analysis
of
eggs
taken
from
the
original
clutches
that
produced
the
captive
adults
.

PASSERINE
NEST
DEFENSE
:
GENERAL
VERSUS
SPECIFIC
RESPONSES
.

Predation
is
the
primary
source
of
nest
mortality
in
most
passerines
;
thus
,
parental
nest
defense
(
any
behavior
to
decrease
predation
or
parasitism
)
has
been
the
focus
of
theoretical
consideration
and
empirical
analyses
based
on
simulated
encounters
.

However
,
the
nest
video
camera
has
made
it
possible
to
examine
real
parental
nest
defense
.

After
a
decade
,
we
are
just
beginning
to
accrue
enough
recorded
parent
-
enemy
interactions
for
more
refined
analyses
.

We
can
now
envision
answering
questions
central
to
natural
selection
for
behaviors
,
nest
sites
,
and
mates
with
real
behavioral
data
.

I
suggest
an
early
focus
for
such
data
should
be
on
the
separation
of
general
and
specific
responses
of
passerines
to
different
types
(
taxa
and
body
size
)
of
predators
.

Such
a
focus
is
necessary
to
evaluate
how
both
parents
and
predators
interact
behaviorally
are
some
components
of
defensive
behaviors
innate
or
just
purely
learned
?

The
effectiveness
of
defensive
behavior
will
likely
interact
with
exposure
and
experience
,
yet
effective
behaviors
should
become
fixed
within
populations
relatively
quickly
.

ECOTOXICOLOGICAL
RISK
ASSESSMENT
OF
AGRICULTURAL
CHEMICAL
EXPOSURE

ON
WINTERING

BURROWING
OWLS

A
simulation
model
was
constructed
that
integrated
dermal
and
oral
exposure
to
evaluate
lethal
and
sublethal
effects
in
birds
due
to
chronic
low
-
level
exposure
to
a
wide
range
of
agricultural
chemicals
.

Burrowing
owls
wintering
in
cotton
or
sorghum
fields
in
South
Texas
,
which
are
chronically
exposed
to
low
levels
of
agricultural
chemicals
were
chosen
to
exemplify
the
use
of
the
model
.

Simulation
results
suggested
that
the
comparative
risk
of
chemical
classes
to
burrowing
owls
wintering
in
South
Texas
cotton
and
sorghum
fields
can
be
described
as
insecticides
>
growth
regulators
and
defoliants
>
herbicides
,
and
that
the
greatest
risk
of
lethal
or
sublethal
effects
was
due
to
OP
and
CB
insecticides
.

The
specific
agricultural
chemicals
indicated
within
each
chemical
class
as
having
the
greatest
potential
to
negatively
affect
wintering
burrowing
owls
are
the
OP
insecticides
chlorpyrifos
,
dicrotophos
,
and
disulfoton
;
the
oxadiazine
insecticide
indoxacarb
;
the
herbicide
trifluralin
;
and
the
defoliants
tribufos
and
paraquat
.

PARADOX
OF
POPULATIONS
AND
POLLUTION
:

THE
ENIGMA
OF
CHESAPEAKE
REGION
WATERBIRDS
Waterbird
populations
have
undergone
some
major
changes
in
the
Chesapeake
Bay
region
of
Maryland
and
Virginia
since
the
mid
1970s
.

In
spite
of
pessimism
in
reaching
nitrogen
-
reduction
goals
in
EPA
's
Chesapeake
Bay
Restoration
Program
and
dramatic
decreases
in
key
resources
such
as
oysters
,
sea
grasses
,
and
blue
crabs
,
a
number
of
waterbird
species
are
increasing
their
ranges
and/or
populations
in
the
Bay
region
.

Bald
Eagles
and
Ospreys
have
exploded
since
the
1970s
,
expanding
up
major
tributaries
of
the
Bay
.

A
number
of
wading
birds
,
but
primarily
Great
Blue
Herons
and
Great
Egrets
,
have
increased
both
in
numbers
of
colonies
and
total
breeding
populations
.

Brown
Pelicans
and
Double
-
crested
Cormorants
have
expanded
northward
into
the
Bay
over
the
past
20
years
.

However
,
certain
ground
-
nesting
seabirds
including
Common
,
Royal
and
Gull
-
billed
Terns
and
Black
Skimmers
have
declined
dramatically
.

Reasons
for
positive
changes
include
release
from
organochloride
chemicals
,
and
possible
changes
in
fisheries
,
while
threats
come
from
nesting
habitat
losses
and
expanding
avian
and
mammalian
predators
.

Restoration
efforts
are
numerous
throughout
the
Bay

so
there
is
reason
for
optimism
.

GUIDELINES
FOR
THE
USE
OF
WILD
BIRDS
IN
RESEARCH

The
Ornithological
Council
has
embarked
on
a
major
revision
of
Guidelines
to
the
Use
of
Wild
Birds
in
Research
.

During
2008
,
editors
evaluated
the
adequacy
of
the
existing
text
and
identified
errors
and
omissions
.

After
a
thorough
literature
review
,
we
drafted
new
text
.

Topics
include
permits
,
capture
and
marking
,
transport
,
housing
,
captive
breeding
,
minor
and
major
procedures
,
and
euthanasia
.

Protocols
for
studies
involving
live
vertebrates
must
be
approved
by
Institutional
Animal
Care
and
Use
Committees
to
insure
that
those
protocols
use
humane
methods
and
minimize
impacts
.

Field
studies
present
challenges
to
IACUC
members
who
have
little
experience
with
field
biology
and
are
unfamiliar
with
the
study
of
a
wide
range
of
species
in
an
uncontrollable
environment
.

Having
the
most
thorough
and
current
information
in
one
place
for
use
by
investigators
and
IACUCs
will
ensure
that
research
protocols
foster
the
humane
handling
of
wild
birds
in
research
,
while
keeping
research
moving
forward
and
without
hindrances
that
are
not
biologically
warranted
.

A
password
-
protected
literature
database
will
be
available
to
all
members
of
all
OC
member
societies

A
LONG
-
TERM
STUDY
OF
CONTAMINANT
EFFECTS
ON
CAVITY
-
NESTING
BIRDS
.

Since
1996
,
we
have
studied
the
effects
of
contaminants
on
reproductive
parameters
of
western
bluebird
(
Sialia
mexicana
)
and
ashthroated
flycatchers
(
Myiarchus
cinerascens
)
populations
nesting
across
a
contaminant
gradient
at
Los
Alamos
National
Laboratory
,
New
Mexico
.

We
have
evaluated
reproductive
success
in
relation
to
soil
contamination
levels
in
the
individual
home
range
.

For
three
years
home
range
size
was
determined
using
foraging
observations
,
and
the
observed
home
ranges
were
correlated
to
measured
and
interpolated
soil
contaminant
data
.

Eggs
were
analyzed
for
PCBs
,
heavy
metals
,
and
radionuclides
and
prey
remains
were
collected
from
study
nests
to
determine
the
potential
contaminant
uptake
from
the
home
range
.

We
measured
nesting
success
,
fledging
success
,
fluctuating
asymmetry
,
parasitism
,
and
immunocompetence
of
nestlings
over
the
13
years
.

In
addition
,
we
have
compared
reproductive
success
to
environmental
variation
,
such
as
a
three
-
year
drought
and
a
large
-
scale
wild
fire
.

IDENTIFYING
HIGH
RISK
AVIAN
SPECIES
CRITICAL
FOR
SURVEILLANCE
OF
AVIAN
INFLUENZA
Management
and
detection
of
highly
pathogenic
influenzas
in
wild
and
domestic
animal
populations
will
require
a
better
understanding
of
the
determinants
of
host
range
.

The
major
host
range
determinant
for
influenza
is
the
binding
site
for
the
virus
,
sialic
acid
that
varies
between
mammals
and
bird
cell
membranes
.

The
characterization
of
sialic
acid
of
species
in
each
order
in
the
Class
Aves
can
be
used
as
a
phylogenetic
guide
map
to
host
range
for
influenza
and
that
can
be
used
to
guide
surveillance
efforts
for
influenza
.

To
gain
entrance
into
cells
,
human
influenza
viruses
bind
preferentially
to
sialic
acid
containing
N
-
acetylneuraminic
acid
alpha2,6-galactose
linkages
while
avian
viruses
bind
preferentially
to
those
containing
N
-
acetylneuraminic
acid
alpha2,3-galactose
linkages
.

Viruses
isolated
from
distinct
bird
species
differ
by
their
recognition
of
the
oligosacchride
receptors
in
the
corresponding
bird
species
.

Sialic
acid
characterization
at
Los
Alamos
National
Laboratory
is
using
a
new
method
that
makes
use
of
stable
isotope
labeled
substrates
for
binding
to
both
neuraminidase
and
hemagglutinin
present
on
the
surface
of
the
virus
,
resulting
in
a
risk
assessment
for
priority
bird
species
.

FIFTEEN

AN
ENDANGERED
HAWAIIAN
HONEYCREEPER

We
monitored
944
nests
of
the
endangered
Palila
(
Loxioides
bailleui
)
during
1988
-
2002
,
generating
one
of
the
longest
datasets
for
any
passerine
.

Females
laid
a
mean
of
1.8
eggs
per
nest
,
and
48
434/904
)
of
eggs
successfully
hatched
.

Age
-
related
and
individual
variation
in
nesting
attempts
was
apparent
.

Second
-
year
birds
comprised
21
%
of
the
Palila
population
,
but
of
127
known
-
age
birds
5
%
of
females
were
in
their
second
-
year
,
and
no
breeding
males
were
second
-
year
birds
.

The
maximum
observed
nesting
attempts
for
a
single
female
was
four
over
6
years
,
while
a
different
female
made
four
attempts
(
two
successful
)
within
a
single
breeding
season
.

We
used
a
Bayesian
analysis
to
estimate
daily
nest
survival
rates
to
account
for
heterogeneous
annual
survival
,
irregular
monitoring
schedules
,
and
uncertainty
of
nest
age
when
discovered
.

There
was
no
significant
correlation
between
estimates
of
summer
nest
density
and
January
population
estimates
in
the
same
or
following
year
.

The
Palila
's
nest
survival
rate
was
greater
than
many
species
with
stable
populations
,
suggesting
that
low
nest
survival
is
not
a
major
factor
in
the
recent
population
decline
.

A
GENERAL
DECLINE
IN

FINCH
NUMBERS
ACROSS
THE
GALAPAGOS
LANDSCAPE
Island
endemics
are
endangered
worldwide
due
to
habitat
loss
,
introduced
species
and
exotic
diseases
.

Until
recently
,
Darwin
's
finches
of
the
Galapagos
Islands
have
largely
been
spared
these
perils
.

However
,
current
genetic
data
suggest
that
populations
of
Darwin
's
finches
are
in
general
decline
,
but
methods
used
to
make
this
inference
are
subject
to
uncertainties
.

Museum
specimens
provide
an
opportunity
to
quantify
genetic
variation
in
the
past
and
assess
genetic
changes
over
time
.

We
tested
the
hypothesis
of
recent
population
decline
in
the
Galapagos
warbler
finches
(
Certhidea
)
by
testing
for
erosion
of
genetic
diversity
that
typically
accompanies
population
decline
.

We
generated
genetic
profiles
from
museum
specimens
collected
approximately
100
years
ago
and
compared
them
to
genotypes
of
modern
specimens
.

This
time
interval
spans
a
period
of
rapid
human
population
growth
and
increased
tourism
in
the
Galapagos
.

A
significant
archipelago
-
wide
decline
in
population
size
is
evident
as
a
general
decrease
in
genetic
variation
and
heterozygosity
over
time
,
with
losses
of
up
to
42
%
in
small
,
peripheral
populations
.

This
study
suggests
Darwin
's
finches
may
soon
suffer
the
same
fate
as
other
island
avifaunas
.

MALE
VIGILANCE
DURING
INCUBATION
:

AN
INDIRECT
FORM
OF
PARENTAL
CARE
Male
contributions
to
offspring
care
can
increase
reproductive
success
and
offspring
quality
.

These
contributions
are
made
directly
or
indirectly
.

In
some
avian
species
,
males
contribute
directly
to
offspring
care
by
sharing
incubation
or
feeding
offspring
after
hatch
.

Indirectly
,
males
can
feed
females
at
the
nest
which
increases
nest
attentiveness
and
offspring
fitness
.

But
some
males
are
constrained
by
nest
predation
from
feeding
at
the
nest
.

We
provide
experimental
evidence
of
a
subtle
male
parental
care
strategy
in
which
males
guard
females
during
incubation
off
-
bouts
.

Males
of
two
species
were
temporarily
removed
during
incubation
.

Male
absence
resulted
in
decreased
female
foraging
efficiency
and
nest
attentiveness
.

Male
absence
was
also
associated
with
increased
levels
of
corticosterone
in
females
,
which
is
associated
with
increased
likelihood
of
nest
abandonment
and
decreased
parental
care
.

We
propose
that
male
vigilance
during
incubation
functions
as
a
form
of
indirect
paternal
care
,
resulting
in
increased
female
foraging
efficiency
and
nest
attentiveness
.

MELODIA
.

Extra

paternity
(
EPP
)
occurs
in
over
75
%
of
socially
monogamous
passerines
.

Despite
considerable
research
effort
,
the
adaptive
benefits
of
this
behaviour
and
its
consequences
are
not
yet
fully
understood
.

Comprehensive
knowledge
of
EPP
is
integral
to
understanding
avian
mating
strategies
and
more
generally
,
the
evolution
of
mate
choice
and
variance
in
reproductive
success
.

While
several
studies
have
shown
that
it
is
often
the
female
that
controls
EPP
,
theories
for
both
direct
and
indirect
genetic
benefits
for
females
have
seldom
been
rigorously
tested
.

I
will
use
a
long

on
Mandarte
Island
,
British
Columbia
,
Canada
to
investigate
the
costs
and
benefits
of
EPP
for
females
in
detail
.

I
will
genotype
over
2000
individuals
to
determine
paternity
and
create
a
corrected
genetic
pedigree
for
the
entire
population
covering
the
past
15
years
.

I
will
use
this
extensive
pedigree
to
test
for
an
indirect
genetic
benefit
for
females
by
using
a
maternal
half
-

fitness
comparison
.

Specifically
,
I
will
test
whether
extrapair

are
fitter

The

Hummingbird
(

The

as
described

I
present
several
lines
of

that
suggest
the
trill
(

)
component
of
the
dive
sound
is
produced
by
wings
,
whereas
the

DISPROPORTIONATE
BILL
LENGTH
DIMORPHISM
AND
NICHE
DIFFERENTIATION
IN
WINTERING
WESTERN
SANDPIPERS

We
tested
two
predictions
of
the
niche
differentiation
hypothesis
in
Western
Sandpipers
(
Calidris
mauri
)
at
two
wintering
sites
in
Mexico
.

First
,
to
test
whether
bill
length
dimorphism
is
larger
at
sites
where
sex
ratios
are
strongly
male
-
biased
,
we
develop
a
migrant
-
based
null
model
to
represent
dimorphism
(
12
based
on
the
average
of
males
and
females
)
in
the
absence
of
competition
.

Relative
to
the
null
model
,
bill
length
dimorphism
was
significantly
larger
at
the
large
site
(
Santa
Maria
:
13.4
but
not
at
the
small
site
(
Punta
Banda
:

12.7
Second
,
we
tested
whether
bill
length
dimorphism
increases
as
sex
ratio
approaches
1:1
.

Although
the
sex
ratio
difference
between
sites
was
only
5
bill
length
dimorphism
increased
marginally
in
the
predicted
direction
.

Additional
comparisons
suggest
a
cline
in
bill
length
dimorphism
that
mirrors
a
latitudinal
gradient
in
prey
burial
depth
.

While
sexual
size
dimorphism
in
the
Western
Sandpiper
likely
derived
from
selection
for
different
body
size
optima
,
intersexual
competition
for
food
on
the
wintering
grounds
appears
to
have
promoted
further
divergence
in
bill
length
.

SLOSS
REVISITED
:

BIRD
SPECIES
RICHNESS
IN
AMAZON
FOREST
PATCHES

In
its
foundation
,
the
field
experiment
“
Biological
Dynamics
of
Forest
Fragments
Project”,in
Brazil
,
aimed
to
determine
how
big
is
big
enough
for
a
tropical
forest
patch
.

The
context
of
this
effort
was
the
SLOSS
debate
,
which
asked
whether
a
Single
Large
Or
Several
Small
patches
are
better
for
wildlife
protection
.

For
three
decades
,
the
Fragments
Project
gave
many
contributions
to
tropical
biology
,
but
it
did
not
address
SLOSS
.

We
employ
occupancy
methods
to
address
the
SLOSS
problem
,
formulated
in
terms
of
understory
bird
species
richness
at
the
Fragments
Project
.

Thirteen
years
of
mistnet
records
are
analyzed
as
presence
-
absence
data
,
producing
estimates
of
local
extinction
and
colonization
rates
for
each
species
.

We
model
those
rates
as
functions
of
patch
size
and
isolation
obtaining
estimates
of
equilibrium
occupancy
in
single
patches
and
sets
of
patches
of
different
sizes
.

The
sum
of
the
species
-
specific
occupancies
provides
an
estimate
of
richness
.

A
single
patch
of
10
ha
has
more
species
than
10
patches
of
1
ha
.

Above
this
size
,
there
is
no
significant
difference
between
a
single
large
and
several
small
patches
.

to

Preliminary

Median
range
size
of

was
15.3

;
maximum

movement
was
15.2
km
.

Seasonal
survival
probability
of
pre

ranged
from
0.82
0.94

Over
the
season
,
sage

departed
sporadically

rather
than
en

,
corresponding
with
the

The

exists
as
to
which
structural
vegetation
characteristics
grassland
birds
use
to
select
habitat
.

Given
that
substantial
information
about
habitat
selection
by
grassland
birds
has
been
published
,
we
conducted
a
literature
review
to
identify
consistent
patterns
of
grassland
bird
-
vegetation
associations
.

We
reviewed
311
species
specific
responses
to
vegetation
structure
from
57
studies
.

Coverage
of
bare
ground
,
grass
,
dead
vegetation
,
forbs
,
and
litter
,
as
well
as
litter
depth
and
vegetation
height
,
were
some
of
the
consistently
important
variables
influencing
grassland
bird
habitat
use
.

Indices
of
vegetation
-
height
density
and
vegetation
volume
were
also
important
in
predicting
grassland
bird
habitat
use
.

By
identifying
the
primary
structural
influences
of
grassland
bird
habitat
use
,
we
hope
to
streamline
habitat
measurements
in
the
field
,
provide
a
standardized
set
of
vegetation
measures
,
and
allow
researchers
to
reduce
the

SUBSPECIES
IN
AVIAN
TAXONOMY
ARE
MAINLY
FOR
CONVENIENCE
For
gross
depiction
of
phenotypic
variation
across
the
range
of
a
species
,
the
subspecies
is
a
taxonomic
category
of
convenience
more
than
biology
.

Debates
about
its
biological
reality
always
are
lively
and
rancorous
,
and
many
are
meaningless
,
because
there
is
no
single
biologically
correct
viewpoint
.

As
a
consequence
of
numerous
evolutionary
forces
,
both
phenotype
and
genotype
vary
across
space
within
many
(
most
species
,
sometimes
abruptly
and
other
times
gradually
.

Capturing
the
essence
of
this
variation
using
simple
Linnaean
nomenclature
is
as
much
art
as
it
is
science
.

Those
who
demand
otherwise
will
forever
find
fault
in
the
system
.

Happily
for
scientific
applications
,
detailed
phylogeographic
studies
incorporating
both
phenotypic
and
genetic
traits
now
represent
the
preferred
modus
operandi
for
describing
geographic
variation
,
evaluating
its
evolutionary
significance
,
and
influencing
conservation
priorities
.

It
is
unrealistic
to
expect
the
trinomial
system
to
express
fully
all
the
biologically
important
nuances
of
geographic
variation
.

It
does
remain
realistic
to
expect
the
system
to
be
useful
as
a
descriptor
of
gross
variability
within
a
species
.

GENETIC
STRUCTURE
IN
HAWAIIAN
SONGBIRDS
IN
RELATION
TO
AVIAN
MALARIA

Most
species
of
native
songbirds
in
the
Hawaiian
Islands
were
historically
distributed
from
sea
level
to
the
upper
limit
of
forest
vegetation
.

Introduced
avian
malaria
is
transmitted
in
Hawaii
by
introduced
Culex
mosquitoes
,
which
are
limited
to
lower
elevations
(
sea
level
to
1500
m

In
part
because
of
these
diseases
,
native
songbirds
almost
entirely
disappeared
from
lower
elevations
sometime
before
Warner
and
van
Riper
conducted
their
pioneering
studies
in
the
1950s
and
1970s
.

Recently
it
was
shown
that
the
Hawaii
Amakihi
is
now
relatively
common
at
low
elevations
,
and
can
survive
in
regions
with
high
malarial
infection
.

It
is
unclear
whether
these
birds
represent
recolonization
of
lower
elevations
by
malaria
resistant
birds
from
higher
elevation
populations
,
from
local
low
elevation
refugia
,
or
both
.

We
applied
mtDNA
,
nuclear
intron
,
and
microsatellite
markers
to
birds
from
study
sites
on
Hawaii
and
showed
that
low
elevation
amakihi
are
genetically
differentiated
from
populations
at
middle
and
high
elevations
,
and
do
not
appear
to
have
only
a
subset
of
the
variation
of
the
higher
populations
.

Our
results
thus
support
the
hypothesis
of
low
elevation
refugial
spread
.

In
addition
,
we
compared
genetic
structure
across
elevations
of
three
other
native
bird
species
that
occur
at
mid
and
high
elevations
(
Apapane
,
Iiwi
,
Elepaio
and
introduced
Japanese
White
-
eyes
,
but
did
not
find
evidence
of
population
structure
as
we
had
found
for
amakihi
.

CONSEQUENCES
OF
SOCIAL
INFORMATION
USE

WITHIN
AND
AMONG
SPECIES

The
use
of
social
information
has
recently
been
documented
in
a
wide
variety
of
taxa
,
yet
we
still
know
very
little
regarding
the
way
in
which
animals
use
such
information
and
if
such
behaviors
have
implications
for
populations
and
communities
.

Here
I
synthesize
recent
experiments
designed
to
interpret
the
complexity
and
consequences
of
using
social
information
by
two
interspecific
competitors
:
the
dominant
least
flycatcher
(
Empidonax
minimus
)
and
the
subordinate
American
redstart
(
Setophaga
ruticilla
Both
species
use
conspecific
and
heterospecific
cues
to
guide
habitat
selection
,
but
in
different
ways
:
flycatchers
are
attracted
to
both
social
cues
,
whereas
redstarts
are
attracted
to
conspecific
cues
while
avoiding
heterospecific
cues
.

Furthermore
,
for
the
least
flycatcher
the
use
of
social
cues
is
mediated
by
local
population
densities
.

In
this
system
the
use
of
social
information
has
two
major
consequences
:
1
)
social
information
use
by
flycatchers
results
in
avoidance
of
small
patches
,
and
2
)
heterospecific
avoidance
of
flycatcher
cues
by
other
migrant
birds
causes
an
alarming
reduction
in
avian
species
richness
.

These
experiments
provide
unique
insight
into
the
importance
of
social
information
use
in
contemporary
landscapes

FRUIT
PULP

AS
A
CALCIUM
SOURCE
FOR
TROPICAL
FRUGIVORES
DURING
REPRODUCTION
Birds
require
significant
calcium
when
breeding
-
females
to
form
egg
shells
,
nestlings
to
form
bones
.

Passerines
do
not
store
calcium
but
meet
their
needs
from
daily
food
.

Graveland
and
Van
Gijzen
(
1994
,
Ardea
82:299
-
314
)
and
others
have
shown
that
insects
and
seeds
comprising
the
normal
diet
of
various
temperate
passerines
do
not
meet
the
calcium
needs
of
laying
females
or
growing
nestlings
;
birds
supplement
their
diets
with
other
calcium
-
rich
animal
foods
.

Relatively
little
is
known
about
the
calcium
content
of
fruits
eaten
by
tropical
avian
frugivores
during
breeding
.

I
analyzed
calcium
content
of
the
fleshy
pulp
of
60
species
of
such
fruits
.

Calcium
contents
of
dry
pulp
ranged
from
0.04
-
2.58
median
0.16

Graveland
and
Van
Gijzen
(
ibid
calculated
that
a
laying
passerine
requires
a
diet
consisting
of
33.5
%
calcium
dry
weight
to
meet
its
daily
needs
.

A
developing
nestling
requires
a
diet
consisting
of
7.8
%
calcium
.

Thus
,
the
pulp
of
the
fruits
considered
here
does
not
supply
sufficient
calcium
to
meet
the
needs
of
laying
females
or
growing
nestlings
,
and
avian
frugivores
must
supplement
their
diets
with
other
,
calcium
-
rich
foods
.

.

In
this
concluding
talk
we
discuss
opportunities
to
isolate
noise
to
assess
its
influence
on
wild
populations
.

Additionally
,
we
examine
how
noise
influences
field
efforts
through
an
example
using
DISTANCE
sampling
surveys
designed
to
assess
the
influence
of
noise
on
observer
detections
.

The
study
included
eight
control
sites
(
gas
wells
without
noisy
compressors
)
and
10
treatment
sites
;
noisy
compressors
on
five
treatment
sites
were
turned
off
during
surveys
(
T1
and
noisy
compressors
were
left
on
at
five
treatment
sites
(
T2
Abundance
,
species
richness
,
and
diversity
did
not
differ
between
controls
and
T1
sites
,
but
both
were
significantly
greater
than
T2
.

This
suggests
that
compressors
significantly
interfered
with
our
detection
ability
.

The
implications
of
these
findings
will
be
discussed
in
the
context
of
other
studies
potentially
influenced
by
noise
.

Anthropogenic
noise
has
been
implicated
as
a
cause
for
declines
in
avian
community
diversities
and
population
densities
;
however
,
these
patterns
are
not
conclusive
because
studies
have
not
explicitly
controlled
for
the
confounding
variables
that
often
accompany
human
activities
,
such
as
edge
effects
or
moving
traffic
or
equipment
.

During
the
summers
of
2005
-
2007
,
we
isolated
noise
experimentally
through
use
of
natural
gas
wells
with
noisy
compressors
as
experimental
treatment
sites
and
wells
without
compressors
as
control
sites
.

We
found
no
difference
in
overall
nest
density
on
plots
with
and
without
compressors
;
however
,
noise
significantly
reduced
nesting
species
richness
.

Individual
species
also
demonstrated
responses
to
the
noise
disturbance
:
Mourning
Dove
nests
were
significantly
more
abundant
on
control
sites
,
whereas
Black
-
chinned
Hummingbird
and
House
Finch
nests
were
significantly
more
abundant
on
sites
with
compressors
.

Several
species
nested
significantly
farther
from
well
pads
on
treatment
sites
than
control
sites
,
including
Gray
Flycatcher
,
Gray
Vireo
,
Black
-
throated
Gray
Warbler
,
and
Spotted
Towhee
.

These
results
suggest
that
noise
alone
can
reduce
nesting
richness
and
alter
the
nesting
patterns
of
numerous
species
.

COMPARING
METHODS
TO
ESTIMATE
RELATIVE
ABUNDANCE
FOR
BREEDING
BIRD
ATLASES

Breeding
Bird
Atlases
,
when
first
started
in
North
America
30
years
ago
,
were
primarily
concerned
with
mapping
distributions
and
confirming
breeding
evidence
for
as
many
bird
species
as
possible
in
each
sampling
unit
.

However
,
estimates
of
abundance
(
or
relative
abundance
)
per
unit
area
,
can
greatly
enhance
the
value
of
atlases
for
detecting
changes
over
time
,
and
for
identifying
population
concentrations
of
each
species
.

Several
approaches
have
been
used
for
estimating
relative
abundance
,
including
standardized
checklists
,
timed
area
searches
,
and
point
counts
.

For
the
second
Ontario
atlas
,
we
found
that
randomly
selected
point
counts
,
primarily
along
roadsides
,
were
more
efficient
and
yielded
estimates
with
greater
precision
per
unit
effort
than
timed
area
searches
of
1x1
km
quadrats
.

Point
counts
were
well
adopted
by
participants
(
during
five
years
69,000
points
were
surveyed
and
had
the
added
advantage
of
encouraging
participants
to
visit
all
parts
of
each
square
,
thus
increasing
the
representativeness
of
habitat
coverage
.

This
approach
is
now
being
used
in
the
Maritimes
and
British
Columbia
.

The
next
challenge
is
to
develop
methods
suitable
for
volunteer
participants
for
estimating
absolute
abundance

MINIMIZING
ADVERSE
IMPACTS
OF
WIND
ENERGY
DEVELOPMENT
ON
WILDLIFE
IN
CANADA

The
Canadian
Wildlife
Service
(
CWS
)
has
been
working
closely
with
the
wind
industry
,
especially
through
the
Canadian
Wind
Energy
Association
(
CanWEA
to
reduce
the
risks
that
wind
turbines
will
cause
adverse
impacts
to
birds
or
other
wildlife
.

CWS
has
developed
guidelines
and
monitoring
protocols
for
environmental
assessment
(
EA
An
innovative
approach
is
a
web
-
based
EA
database
for
proponents
to
store
and
maintain
preand
post
-
construction
monitoring
data
associated
with
wind
turbines
.

This
will
be
used
for
meta
-
analyses
of
data
from
multiple
projects
to
ensure
consistent
analysis
methods
and
to
enhance
statistical
power
for
evaluating
both
direct
and
indirect
impacts
.

Several
joint
government
-
university
-
industry
research
projects
have
also
been
initiated
to
address
key
uncertainties
related
to
predicting
wildlife
impacts
.

These
include
use
of
weather
and
marine
radars
to
identify
bird
migration
concentration
areas
and
flight
altitudes
in
relation
to
turbine
heights
(
using
newly
developed
open
source
software
and
use
of
satellite

(
to
map
habitat

)
and
energetics
studies
to
evaluate
impacts
of

STABLE

ANALYSIS
ALLOWS
CRYPTIC
YEARLING
IDENTIFICATION
IN
WESTERN
,
LEAST
,
AND
SEMIPALMATED
SANDPIPERS
Plumage
differences
can
be
used
to
distinguish
yearlings
from
older
adult
shorebirds
in
winter
and
spring
,
but
pre
-
basic
moult
and
worn
coverts
generally
preclude
using
this
aging
method
during
fall
migration
.

Since
juvenile
flight
feathers
are
retained
through
the
first
three
migrations
,
excessive
primary
wear
has
been
used
to
distinguish
fall
migrant
yearlings
from
adults
.

We
show
that
hydrogen
isotope
analysis
of
flight
feathers
is
a
substantially
more
reliable
method
for
distinguishing
fall
migrant
yearlings
from
older
adults
in
three
calidrid
sandpiper
species
.

Feather
hydrogen
signatures
showed
a
bimodal
distribution
in
adults
of
all
species
,
reflecting
their
growth
on
arctic
breeding
grounds
versus
elsewhere
.

The
more
negative
adult
signature
modes
overlapped
species
-
specific
juvenile
signatures
,
confirming
their
identity
as
arctic
-
grown
feathers
from
the
previous
season
and
allowing
identification
of
yearlings
.

In
contrast
,
feather
wear
was
not
significantly
different
between
putative
yearlings
and
older
birds
.

Hydrogen
stable
isotope
analysis
is
thus
a
useful
tool
for
distinguishing
yearling
and
adult
sandpipers
.

This
can
be
applied
in
migration
studies
as
yearlings
and
adults
may
exhibit
different
feeding
behaviour
or
habitat
use
.

ECOLOGY

MANAGEMENT
OF
BOBOLINKS

IN
EASTERN
HAYFIELDS

The
bobolink
(
Dolichonyx
oryzivorus
)
is
an
obligate
grassland
bird
declining
throughout
its
range
.

The
St

Lawrence
Great

Lakes
physiogeographic
area
supports
a
large
breeding
population
,
and
within
this
area
one
of
the
swiftest
declines
is
occurring
in
Qu&#233;bec
.

We
determined
nest

and
nest

of
bobolinks
in
hayfields
of
Qu&#233;bec
and
Ontario
in
the

compared
between

and
random

and

)
successful

.

Bobolinks
selected
higher

than
recently

Since
bobolinks
select
specific
vegetation

for
nest
sites
,
various
management
schemes
have
the
potential
to
increase
habitat
quality
and
nest

of
this
declining
species
.

Management
should
be
two

,
including
,
ideally
(

)
delaying
hay

cropping
and
planting
a
mixture
of
grass

to
attract

and
,

limiting
ecological

LINKING
SPECIES
'
ECOLOGICAL
TRAITS
WITH
ENVIRONMENTAL
ATTRIBUTES
:
EVIDENCE
OF
ENVIRONMENTAL
FILTERS

AT
SMALL
SPATIAL
SCALES
.

A
basic
tenet
of
evolutionary
ecology
is
that
the
environment
imposes
a
filter
on
life
history
and
ecological
traits
of
species
,
thus
determining
species
'
habitat
distributions
and
producing
associations
between
those
traits
and
environmental
attributes
.

These
associations
have
usually
been
investigated
at
large
spatial
scales
(
e.g
temperate
-
tropical
comparisons
of
clutch
size

We
were
interested
in
whether
the
operation
of
environmental
filters
(
i.e
trait
-
attribute
associations
)
could
be
detected
at
within
-
habitat
scales
.

We
applied
"

"
analysis
to
birds
in
southern
California
coastal
sage
scrub
vegetation
embedded
in
a
mosaic
of
natural
and
anthropogenic
landscape
elements
.

We
linked
abiotic
,
local
and
landscape
-
scale
environmental
attributes
with
bird
species
'
life
history
and
ecological
traits
.

Even
within
this
general
habitat
type
,
we
found
strong
associations
ranging
from
obvious
(
e.g
rock8/4/2008AOU
/
COS
/
SCO

Portland
,
OR

crevice
nesters
were
positively
associated
with
the
presence
of
rocks
)
to
more
subtle
(
e.g
avian
body
mass
was
positively
associated
with
the
amount
of
exotic
grasslands
in
the
landscape
Such
associations
allow
us
to
predict
which
suites
of
species
are
most
sensitive
to
changes
in
environmental
variables
based
on
specific
shared
ecological
traits

THE
IMPORTANCE
OF

IN
DETERMINING
SITE

PATTERNS
FOR
A
MONTANE
FOREST
SONGBIRD

We
evaluated
metapopulation
dynamics
and
their
relationship
to
habitat
at
multiple
scales
in
an
occupancy
model
framework
for
a
montane
fir

specialist
,
Bicknell

Thrush
.

Quantifying

this
songbird
has
not
been
addressed
.

Local
habitat
characteristics
were
measured
at
each
site
and
landscape
-
level
features
were
calculated
using
a
predictive
habitat
model
.

Models
considering
all
combinations
of
landscape
and
local
habitat
were
evaluated
for
individual
estimates
of
probability
of
detection
,
initial
site
occupancy
,
site
colonization
and
local
extinction
.

Landscape
characteristics
alone
were
not
significant
in
driving
population
dynamics
.

Additively
,
landscape
and
local
habitat
were
most
important
for
probability
of
occupancy
and
local
extinction
.

Probability
of
colonization
was
driven
mainly
by
local
habitat
.

Preserving
large
tracts
of
habitat
may
not
be
sufficient
in
assuring
future
species
persistence
,
but
could
minimize
local
extinction
risk
.

Careful
consideration
should
be
given
to
local
habitat
features
,
particularly
to
maintain
adequate
colonization
rates
.

Because
both
scales
are
correlated
,
in
intact
montane
forest
patches
,
landscape
-
scale
attributes
may
serve
as
a
surrogate
for
identifying
quality

are

THE

OF
A
USER

ACTIVATED
TRAP
FOR
DOUBLE

CORMORANTS

The
most
widely
-
used
and
effective
means
to
capture
double
-
creasted
cormorants
(
Phalacrocorax
auritus
)
is
through
the
use
of
"
softcatch
"
leghold
traps
at
rookeries
.

Because
,
this
method
may
result
in
injuries
and
the
capture
of
non
target
species
and
is
not
effective
outside
of
the
breeding
season
,
alternative
techniques
are
necessary
.

We
have
developed
a
trap
that
can
be
used
throughout
the
year
in
a
variety
of
settings
and
can
be
triggered
remotely
to
capture
selected
individuals
and
thereby
reducing
stress
and
injury
.

The
trap
design
is
a
modified
"
bow
net
"
commonly
used
for
capturing
raptors
.

The
T
-
shaped
body
will
allow
birds
to
perch
comfortably
and
the
remote
activated
metal
arms
create
a
clam
shell
with
netting
to
capture
the
birds
.

EVIDENCE
FOR
SPECIATION
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
GEOGRAPHIC
BARRIERS

TO
DISPERSAL
IN
PACIFIC
SEABIRDS

According
to
the
classical
allopatric
model
of
speciation
,
new
species
arise
when
populations
are
isolated
for
a
prolonged
period
by
a
geographic
barrier
to
dispersal
,
resulting
in
the
evolution
of
intrinsic
or
extrinsic
reproductive
barriers
.

This
model
does
not
provide
a
satisfactory
model
of
speciation
in
seabirds
,
which
encounter
few
geographic
barriers
to
dispersal
.

My
research
group
is
using
molecular
markers
to
study
alternative
barriers
to
in
seabirds

We
have
found
strong
evidence
for

Finally

SCHEDULING
IN
PASSERINE

ANNUAL
CYCLE

Almost
all
North
American
and
European
passerine
resident
species
undertake
a
complete
molt
right
after
breeding
as
adults
,
while
complete
molts
among
long

migrants
occur
throughout
the
year
:
right
after
breeding
,
during
or
after
fall
migration
,
or
shortly
before
spring
migration
.

To
assess
this
variability
in
molt
scheduling
,
I
scored
feather
wear
on
museum
specimens
throughout
the
year
.

Feather
wear
rates
were
determined
by
visually

the

.

Wear

were
comparable
for
North

and
European

.

Migrants
showed
higher
feather

rates
,
though
migration
itself
could
not
be
detected
in
the
feather

scores
.

Migrants
to

showed
the
highest

This
suggests
that
delaying

may
represent
an

BEHAVIORAL
AND
ISOTOPIC
EVIDENCE
OF
MULTIPLE
MOLT
AND
MIGRATION

STRATEGIES
IN
WESTERN
PAINTED
BUNTINGS

There
is
biogeographic
variation
in
the
sequence
basic
molt
and
autumn
migration
among
Painted
Buntings
(
Passerina
ciris

Previous
research
suggests
that
this
variation
is
structured
in
distinct
demographic
units
rather
than
as
a
cline
.

That
is
,
eastern
coastal
populations
molt
on
their
breeding
territories
prior
to
migration
.

These
eastern
populations
are
separated
from
midwestern
populations
by
500kms
.

In
midwestern
populations
Painted
Buntings
migrate
off
the
breeding
ground
prior
to
basic
molt
.

To
examine
the
midwestern
life
-
history
strategy
,
we
took
7
hatch
year
painted
buntings
from
Oklahoma
into
captivity
in
2007
.

We
monitored
migratory
restlessness
of
these
birds
in
captivity
throughout
the
autumn
.

An
index
of
restlessness
suggests
that
all
possible
sequences
of
molt
and
migration
occur
within
Oklahoma
population
.

This
inference
is
consistent
with
stable
isotope
data
from
feathers
grown
of
44
painted
buntings
collected
in
Oklahoma
.

Stable
isotope
ratios
of
carbon
from
these
birds
suggest
that
multiple
molt
and
migration
strategies
exist
at
a
local
scale
.

The
apparent
variation
in
the
sequence
of
the
molt
and
migration
lifehistory
events
in
this
species
makes
it
an
ideal
candidate
for
comparison
of
the
importance
of
programmed
migratory
behavior
relative
to
the
influence
of
environmental
conditions

Canopy
cover
has
been
identified
as
an
important
correlate
of
Mexican
spotted
owl
(
Strix

lucida
)
habitat
,
yet
management
guidelines
in
a
recovery
plan
for
this
threatened
owl
did
not
address
canopy
cover
.

These
guidelines
emphasized
parameters
included
in
U.
S.
Forest
Service
stand
exams
,
and
canopy
cover
typically
is
not
sampled
in
these
inventories
.

Algorithms
exist
to
estimate
canopy
cover
from
stand
-
exam
data
,
but
the
accuracy
of
resulting
estimates
is
unknown
.

We
compared
field
data
on
observed
canopy
cover
within
forest
stands
used
by
radio
-
marked
Mexican
spotted
owls
with
estimates
derived
from
those
analysis
routines
.

We
also
estimated
proportions
of
these
stands
that
would
be
misclassified
by
derived
estimates
,
based
on
arbitrary
criteria
for
minimum
canopy
cover
.

Canopy
-
cover
estimates
derived
from
stand
-
exam
data
differed
widely
from
observed
canopy
cover
in
many
stands
,
and
derived

frequently
misclassified
stands
based
on
canopy

criteria
.

These
algorithms
performed
worst
in
mesic
mixed

conifer
forest
,
the
forest
type
in
which
spotted

occur
most
commonly
.

We
conclude
that
existing

algorithms
are
not
useful
for
assessing

for
Mexican

are
listed
as
a
species
of
special
concern
and
have
been
proposed
for
listing
as
an

in
California
.

Naval

of
Burrowing

in
coastal
southern
California
.

NBC
also
supports
the
federally
endangered
California
Least

(
Sterna

In
the
past
,
Burrowing
owls
that
preyed
on
terns
were
killed
or
relocated
.

However
,
numbers
of
Burrowing
owl
breeding
pairs
have
recently
declined
on

.

The
purpose
of
this
study
was
to
determine
factors
associated
with
local
declines
in
Burrowing
owl
breeding
pairs
on
NBC
,
and
develop
a
strategy
for
managing
Burrowing

in
accordance
with
California

goals
.

We
monitored
Burrowing

for
two
years
;
interviewed
local
personnel
associated
with
predator

,
Bird
Air
Strike

;
surveyed

and
researched

We
found
a
combination
of
factors
contributed
to
recent
Burrowing

Our
results
have
implications
for
current
Burrowing

WADING
BIRDS
IN
THE
EVERGLADES
:

THE
ROLE
OF
AVIAN
STUDIES
IN
WETLAND
ECOSYSTEM
RESTORATION

Several
types
of
avian
habitat
models
and
empirical
analyses
have
direct
application
to
wetland
ecosystem
restoration
.

In
the
Everglades
,
historic
counts
of
wading
bird
nests
provided
compelling
evidence
of
a
degrading
ecosystem
.

The
index
of
nest
numbers
declined
so
much
that
it
overwhelmed
the
variability
and
uncertainty
in
the
estimates
.

The
historic
data
were
also
used
to
develop
performance
measures
,
quantitative
assessments
of
restoration
progress
that
are
applied
to
contemporary
monitoring
data
.

Field
research
studies
identified
species
'
behavioral
constraints
and
habitat
limitations
,
which
helped
to
reconstruct
historic
habitat
conditions
.

The
field
studies
also
produced
parameter
estimates
that
were
used
in
spatially
-
explicit
habitat
models
.

Evaluation
models
are
habitat
models
that
were
driven
by
a
system
-
wide
hydrologic
simulation
model
.

These
coarse
-
grained
models
were
used
to
evaluate
competing
restoration
plans
.

Assessment
models
are
habitat
models
that
can
be
used
to
assess
the
progress
of
restoration
,
much
like
performance
measures
.

For
this
type
of
model
,
a
Resource
Selection
Function
was
developed
from
empirical
data
and
linked
to
a
GIS
.

It
has
a
finer
spatial
resolution
and
is
also
suitable
for
assessing
smaller

specific
effects

An

were
collected
on
eight
study

Tree

Three
silvicultural
practices
with
varying
degrees
of

were
implemented
between
the
two
field
seasons
.

Of
the
three
foraging

observed
,
vegetation

was
most
common
(
69
%
of
observations
sally

were
11
%
and
18
%
of

respectively
.

The

of
the
canopy
and
on
the
outer
20
%
of
branch
tips
and
63
%
of

were

to
canopy

.

We
suggest
that
this
information
be
incorporated
into
future
species

As

INFLUENCE
OF
DIET
ON
OSPREY
POPULATION

DYNAMICS
The
Chesapeake
Bay
Osprey

Pandion
haliaetus</em
population
has
exhibited
significant
spatial
variation
in
growth
rate
since
the
banning
of
DDT
.

In
general
,
the
fastest
and
slowest
rates
have
occurred
in
the
lowest
and
highest
salinity
areas
,
respectively
.

We
hypothesized
that
the
spatial
variation
in
the
population
growth
reflected
differences
in
reproductive
success
mediated
through
the
provisioning
ability
of
parents
.

To
address
this
,
we
compared
diet
composition
,
provisioning
rates
,
and
reproductive
success
of
Ospreys
in
upper
and
lower
estuarine
sites
.

We
found
that
Ospreys
not
only
targeted
different
fish
species
spatially
,
but
that
prey
were
nearly
significantly
more
massive
(
p=0.054
)
and
more
energy
rich
(
p=0.056
)
in
the
upper
estuarine
sites
.

Additionally
,
Ospreys
in
the
upper
estuarine
sites
exhibited
significantly
faster
provisioning
rates
(
p=0.005
)
and
significantly
higher
reproductive
success
(
p<0.001
We
therefore
show
,
for
the
first
time
within
a
single
population
,
that
Osprey
diet
quality
can
influence
reproductive
success
,
and
ultimately
population
growth
,
on
a
broad
spatial
scale
.

Our
results
also
indicate
that
Atlantic
menhaden
em
>

Brevoortia
tyrannus</em
may
be
less
available
today
to
Ospreys
than
in
the
past
,
which
has
important
implications
.

PHYLOGENETIC
STRUCTURE
OF
TYPICAL
ANTBIRD
(
THAMNOPHILIDAE
)
COMMUNITIES
Novel
methods
allow
making
inferences
about
the
processes
involved
in
the
coexistence
of
species
and
community
assembly
using
hypotheses
of
phylogenetic
relationships
and
character
evolution
.

The
first
approach
to
determine
which
processes
lead
to
observed
patterns
is
establishing
the
phylogenetic
structure
of
communities
,
which
can
be
composed
by
species
that
are
more
(
clustered
)
or
less
(
overdispersed
)
related
than
expected
by
chance
.

We
used
information
on
typical
antbird
(
Thamnophilidae
)
communities
obtained
from
the
literature
to
test
the
hypothesis
that
competitive
interactions
are
more
important
in
the
assembly
of
communities
at
a
local
scale
.

Assuming
ecological
traits
are
phylogenetically
conserved
,
this
hypothesis
predicts
that
local
communities
should
be
overdispersed
as
a
result
of
competitive
exclusion
among
close
relatives
.

Using
two
metrics
of
phylogenetic
structure
,
we
found
that
communities
do
not
follow
our
prediction
because
local
assemblages
tend
to
be
clustered
or
exhibit
no
phylogenetic
signal
.

This
may
suggest
that
traits
present
on
close
relatives
may
be
labile
enough
to
allow
coexistance
.

However
,
ongoing
studies
on
trait
evolution
will
allow
us
to
understand
how
might
ecological
differentiation
allow
close
relatives
to
coexist
locally
.

:

DELAWARE
'S
SECOND
BREEDING
BIRD
ATLAS

From
2008
through
2012
,
Delaware
is
conducting
its
second
breeding
bird
atlas
.

Although
similar
to
most
other
atlases
in
many
respects
,
Delaware
's
second
atlas
includes
novel
atlasing
methods
to
increase
and
improve
data
collected
for
its
breeding
bird
populations
.

Data
collected
for
this
atlas
will
include
migration
information
to
evaluate
safe
dates
.

Changes
in
code
applications
add
to
information
about
the
breeding
phenology
of
Delaware
's
birds
.

Re
-
evaluating
safe
dates
and
breeding
phenology
provides
useful
insight
and
additional
baseline
data
to
make
future
comparisons
in
the
wake
of
widespread
habitat
loss
and
the
impending
impacts
of
climate
change
.

Using
diversity
estimations
in
conjunction
with
diversity
data
from
the
first
atlas
,
Delaware
can
more
accurately

assess
atlas
block

and
more
efficiently
use
the
service
of
atlas
volunteers
to
adequately
cover
the
entire

.

Finally
,
Delaware
's
atlas
introduces
new
features
to
atlas
databasing
that
future
atlas
projects
can
utilize
and
benefit
from
.

Working
within
the

application
,
developed
and
maintained
by
the

,
Delaware

of
some
of
these
novel

HAMPSHIRE

The
habitat
features
selected
by

success
and
may

.

We
measured

around
35
Canada
Warbler
(
Wilsonia

)
nests
in
2005
-
2007
and
compared
these
measures
to
other
random
sites
within
and
outside
territories
.

We
measured
ground

in
each
of
four

DBH
2.5
cm
,
and
2.5
cm
)
for
both
deciduous
and
coniferous
stems
.

Ferns
were
nearly
twice
as
dense
on
territories
but
not
different
between
nest
and
non

nest
plots
.

Nest
sites
were
three
times
less
conspicuous
than
both
territory
and
non

territory
plots
.

Nests
had
higher
stem
densities
in
the
two
smaller
diameter
size
classes
1.0
cm
and
2.5
cm
and
for
both
conifers
and
deciduous
stems
.

Conifers
were
significantly
more
dense
in
the
larger
size
class
.

Successful
nests
(
N
25
)
had
more
than
double
the
deciduous
stems
between
1.0
and
2.5
cm
DBH
compared
to
unsuccessful
nests
(

These
data
corroborate
the
high
importance
of

THE
CAUSES
AND
CONSEQUNECES
OF
DOUBLE
BROODING
IN
THE
WOOD

Double
brooding
is
a
common
reproductive
strategy
in
songbirds
that
can
increase
reproductive
success
during
the
breeding
season
,
yet
not
all
females
double
brood
.

The
costs
associated
with
double
brooding
are
not
well
-
studied
,
particularly
the
costs
of
overlapping
parental
care
with
moult
and
preparing
for
migration
.

This
study
was
conducted
in
Northwestern
Pennsylvania
from
2007
-
2008
.

I
captured
and
monitored
wood
thrush
pairs
(
N=45
)
throughout
their
breeding
season
to
quantify
reproductive
effort
,
and
examined
the
timing
and
extent
of
moult
.

In
2007
,
47
%
of
females
attempted
a
second
brood
.

Adults
did
not
begin
moulting
until
midAugust
,
and
so
late
breeding
birds
overlapped
parental
care
with
moult
.

Some
adults
departed
the
study
site
before
completing
moult
;
feather
isotope
analysis
will
be
used
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
double
brooded
birds
moult
during
migration
.

PATTERNS

,
AND
THE
DISTRIBUTION

MIGRATORY
STRATEGIES
IN
THE
RUSSIAN
BOREAL
FOREST
AVIFAUNA
Comparisons
of
the
avifauna
in
the
Palearctic
and
Nearctic
have
focused
on
limited
portions
of
the
two
regions
.

This
study
assessed
the
geographic
pattern
in
the
abundance
,
species
richness
,
and
importance
of
different
migration
patterns
of
the
avifauna
of
the
boreal
forest
of
Eurasia
based
on
point
counts
from
14
sites
from
Europe
to
Siberia
and
East
Asia
.

Overall
abundance
was
highest
in
the
eastern
and
western
extremes
and
lowest
in
the
continent
center
,
whereas
the
abundance
of
tropical
and
short
-
distance
migrants
displayed
an
east
-
west
gradient
,
with
tropical
migrants
increasing
in
the
east
and
short
-
distance
migrants
in
the
west
.

While
overall
species
richness
showed
no
geographic
pattern
,
richness
within
migratory
classes
showed
patterns
weaker
,
but
similar
to
their
abundance
patterns
.

Overall
abundance
was
correlated
with
climatic
variables
that
relate
to
continentality
.

The
abundances
of
birds
within
different
migration
strategies
were
correlated
an
east
-
west
gradient
in
precipitation
.

The
distribution
patterns
for
migrant
types
were
related
to
both
climate
and
locational
variables
,
thus
the
patterns
could
be
explained
by
either
climatic
regime
or
the
accessibility
of
winter
habitats
both
historical
and
current
.

REPRODUCTIVE

AN

OR
75
Settlement
and
dispersal
decisions
have
a
direct
influence
on
an
individual
's
fitness
.

The
relative
benefits
of
different
dispersal
strategies
may
vary
by
species
,
depending
on
the
trade
-
offs
involved
.

Some
raptors
are
known
to
be
nomadic
,
where
breeding
settlement
rapidly
tracks
cyclical
prey
abundance
;
however
,
it
is
more
common
for
birds
to
exhibit
some
level
of
fidelity
to
nesting
locations
.

Prior
experience
in
an
area
may
allow
birds
to
secure
higher
quality
territories
and
mates
,
initiate
breeding
earlier
,
avoid
predation
,
and
acquire
more
resources
for
successful
reproduction
.

We
tested
the
hypothesis
that
individuals
exhibiting
different
dispersal
strategies
will
benefit
differentially
from
past
experience
in
the
area
.

Stable
hydrogen
isotope
analysis
of
primary
feathers
was
used
to
characterize
large
-
scale
breeding
dispersal
of
American
kestrels
em
>
Falco
sparverius</em
in
Saskatchewan
.

Preliminary
results
show
that
approximately
90
%
of
kestrels
(
n
124
)
were
immigrants
to
the
area
.

We
will
present
results
of
analyses
testing
whether
reproductive
effort
and
success
,
and
breeding
phenology
differ
between
local
and
immigrant
kestrels
,
as
we
would
predict
if
local
knowledge
of
the
area
confers
reproductive
advantages
.

HABITAT
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
BARRED

OWL
AND
SPOTTED
OWL
SITES
IN
OLYMPIC
NATIONAL
PARK
.

The
Barred
Owl
(
Strix
varia
)
was
first
documented
in
Olympic
National
Park
(
ONP
)
in
1985
.

Since
that
time
,
an
increasing
body
of
evidence
suggests
that
this
species
is
excluding
the
Northern
Spotted
Owl
(
Strix
occidentalis
caurina
)
from
historically
occupied
sites
.

In
order
to
identify
sites
where
Spotted
Owls
are
most
likely
to
persist
in
the
face
of
Barred
Owl
competition
,
we
compiled
detections
of
Barred
Owls
incidental
to
Spotted
Owl
monitoring
efforts
in
ONP
from
1992
to
2003
,
and
classified
52
monitored
Spotted
Owl
sites
by
presence
or
absence
of
Barred
Owls
within
800
m
in
any
prior
year
.

We
measured
habitat
characteristics
at
19
Barred
Owl
and
46
Spotted
Owl
activity
centers
and
compared
both
stand
and
landscape
scale
attributes
between
these
,
as
well
as
between
the
Spotted
Owl
sites
with
and
without
Barred
Owl
detections
.

Spotted
Owls
occurred
on
steeper
,
higher
elevation
sites
and
on
drier
slope
positions
than
Barred
Owls
.

Similarly
,
the
Spotted
Owl
sites
most
likely
to
be
occupied
by
Barred
Owls
were
those
that
were
less
steep
and
at
lower
elevations
.

were
performed
on
mitochondrial
genes
cytochrome

and
cytochrome
oxidase
I
to
determine
the
maternal
parent
,
and
on
the
nuclear

-
mos
gene
to
determine
the
paternal
parent
.

The
results
of
the
genetic
analysis
indicate
that
the
mother
was
a
Yellow
Warbler

>
Dendroica

petechia</em
and
the
father
was
either
a
Yellow
Warbler
or
Common

em

Geothlypis

Based
on
the
appearance
and
morphology
of
the
bird
,
it
is
extremely
probable
that
the
bird
was
a
Yellow
Warbler
x
Common
Yellowthroat
hybrid
.

Preliminary
research
indicates
that
this
may
be
the
first
reported
hybridization
between
these
two
species

PRODUCTION

IGA
-
SPECIFIC
ANTI
-

SERA
The
IgA
antibody
response
plays
a
vital
role
in
mucosal
immunity
as
it
functions
to
neutralize
pathogens
at
the
mucosal
surface
and
thus
impedes
attachment
to
underlying
tissues
.

Although
the
importance
of
IgA
in
the
mucosal
immunity
of
galliform
birds
has
been
established
,
studies
examining
IgA
-
based
immunity
in
passerine
birds
are
lacking
,
perhaps
due
in
part
to
the
absence
of
reagents
that
can
detect
passerine
IgA.

To
produce
anti
-
sera
specific
for
house
finch
(
Carpodacus
mexicanus
)
IgA
,
rabbits
were
immunized
with
a
fragment
of
the
house
finch
alpha
heavy
chain
.

A
region
of
the
house
finch
IgA
heavy
chain
was
PCR
-
amplified
from
spleen
cDNA
.

The
predicted
amino
acid
sequence
was
found
to
share
55
%
and
46
%
identity
with
the
IgA
heavy
chain
of
mallard
and
chicken
,
respectively
.

The
heavy
chain
fragment
was
produced
in
a
bacterial
expression
system
,
purified
,
and
used
for
immunization
.

In
western
blot
,
the
anti
-
serum
detected
a
band
within
the
immunoglobulin
heavy
chain
region
.

Using
immunohistochemistry
,
the
antiserum
stained
plasma
cells
in
the
Harderian
gland
and
conjunctiva
of
house
finches
with
conjunctivitis
associated
with
Mycoplasma
gallisepticum
infection

SIGNALING
OF
NEED
VERSUS
LEARNING
:
CAN
HUNGRY
NESTLINGS
BE

TRAINED
TO
REDUCE

THEIR
BEGGING
?

Recent
evidence
point
to
learning
effects
on
begging
,
but
it
is
unclear
whether
nestlings
reduce
their
begging
after
it
was
not
successful
;
or
,
rather
,
whether
to
do
so
they
must
first
acquire
positive
experience
with
low
begging
levels
.

To
explore
this
question
we
conducted
three
hand
-
feeding
experiments
with
pairs
of
house
sparrow
em

>
Passer
domesticus</em
nestlings
.

In
the
first
two
experiments
,
nestlings
targeted
to
lower
their
begging
were
rewarded
mainly
or
only
for
low
begging
postures
,
but
did
not
lower
their
begging
.

Controlled
by
their
behavioral
response
-
function
,
hungry
nestlings
were
'
stuck
'
using
high
postures
without
being
able
to
experience
the
potential
success
of
low
postures
.

In
the
third
experiment
,
begging
postures
were
reduced
when
nestlings
were
rewarded
for
any
posture
,
ensuring
that
satiation
would
provide
their
initial
positive
experience
with
low
postures
.

We
suggest
that
parents
are
unlikely
to
reduce
offspring
begging
levels
by
simply
ignoring
them
.

However
,
they
might
be
able
to
do
so
by
attending
to
the
begging
as
soon
as
possible
,
thereby
allowing
their
offspring
to
explore
low
begging
and
learn
that
it
is
sufficiently
effective
.

PHYLOGENY
OF
THE
PALEOGNATHOUS
BIRDS
USING
NUCLEAR
EXON
SEQUENCES
.

Relationships
of
ratites
and
tinamous
have
received
extensive
attention
for
many
decades
.

Previous
morphological
and
genetic
work
,
including
DNA
hybridization
and
analyses
of
complete
mitochondrial
genomes
,
have
either
assumed
or
supported
monophyly
of
ratites
,
with
tinamous
as
their
sister
taxon
.

In
contrast
,
we
found
non
-
monophyly
of
the
ratites
.

Our
data
included
about
9.9
kb
of
slowly
-
evolving
nuclear
exon
data
(
eight
loci
)
for
which
sequence
alignment
was
not
an
issue
.

Taxa
in
our
study
included
all
genera
of
extant
ratites
,
three
genera
of
tinamous
,
and
as
outgroups
we
used
four
diverse
neognaths
and
two
crocodylians
.

Trees
derived
from
these
data
show
support
for
tinamous
nested
within
ratites
.

However
,
not
all
nuclear
loci
we
used
seemed
suitable
for
deeplevel
systematics
due
to
skewed
base
composition
among
taxa
.

Nevertheless
,
our
results
were
not
due
to
the
inclusion
of
these
compromised
data
.

Eliminating
the
two
most
heterogeneous
loci
left
a
data
set
with
a
substantial
8.6
kb
of
sequence
lacking
the
problem
of
appreciable
base
composition
variation
;
analyses
of
these
filtered
data
also
showed
ratites
as
non
-
monophyletic
.

SONGBIRDS
Acoustic
recording
of
nocturnal
migrant
songbirds
is
being
developed
and
promoted
as
a
tool
to
monitor
populations
of
night
migrants
.

Application
of
flight
call
recordings
as
a
monitoring
tool
requires
that
we
assess
the
ability
,
both
the
human
and
computer
elements
,
to
effectively
analyze
recordings
.

We
isolated
100
random
15-minute
audio
segments
recorded
by
microphones
in
western
Pennsylvania
during
the
2007
fall
migration
.

Five
observers
of
varying
experience
logged
warbler
and
sparrow
flight
calls
using
the
sound
-
analysis
software
Raven
.

We
also
examined
the
consistency
among
observers
in
categorizing
candidate
sounds
identified
by
software
as
either
calls
or
non
-
calls
.

There
was
considerable
variation
among
observers
in
manually
locating
flight
calls
within
nocturnal
recordings
.

Strong
differences
between
individual
observers
indicate
that
assessments
of
software
effectiveness
for
future
recording
sites
utilize
multiple
experienced
observers
.

Substantial
variation
among
observers
in
classifying
candidate
sound
clips
additionally
demonstrates
the
need
to
standardize
data
between
sites
.

Future
recording
sites
should
be
carefully
planned
,
in
order
to
minimize
the
effect
of
environmental
variables
such
as
insect
noise
and
non
-
migrant
calls
upon
software
efficiency
and
inter
-
observer
variation
.

One
of
the
symposia
featured
at
this
meeting
focuses
on
non
-
invasive
determination
of
body
composition
,
with
a
goal
of
finding
a
Holy
Grail
method
.

Ideally
,
such
a
technology
should
provide
highly
accurate
and
precise
,
direct
measurements
of
the
three
major
body
components
(
fat
,
lean
and
water
)
on
non
-
anaesthetized
subjects
within
minutes
,
allowing
for
high
throughput
and
minimal
stress
.

It
should
also
be
field
-
portable
.

Here
we
report
on
a
validation
of
a
magnetic
resonance
body
composition
analyzer
that
meets
all
of
the
above
criteria
.

The
unit
does
not
provide
images
of
internal
structure
,
but
rather
measures
fat
mass
,
lean
mass
and
total
water
within
a
cylindrical
volume
in
which
an
awake
bird
is
loosely
held
in
a
plastic
tube
.

We
measured
the
body
composition
of
birds
of
a
variety
of
body
sizes
and
compared
it
to
traditional
proximate
analysis
(
drying
and
solvent
extraction
)
and
heavy
water
dilution
.

The
analyzer
provided
extremely
accurate
and
precise
measurements
of
all
three
body
components
and
promises
to
open
new
doors

BLOOD
METABOLITES
AS
INDICATORS
OF
PHYSIOLOGICAL
STATE
AND
BODY
CONDITION

The
analysis
of
metabolite
concentrations
in
blood
has
been
used
for
decades
in
human
and
veterinary
medicine
to
assess
physiological
and/or
health
status
.

Since
many
metabolites
can
be
measured
relatively
easily
and
inexpensively
,
metabolite
profiling
has
naturally
been
incorporated
into
studies
of
a
variety
of
wild
animals
.

I
will
review
how
blood
metabolites
have
been
employed
in
bird
studies
and
illustrate
how
their
use
and
interpretation
is
context
specific
.

One
of
the
great
advantages
of
metabolites
is
their
potential
to
indicate
rates
and
direction
of
change
in
body
condition
.

Using
the
example
of
migratory
stopover
I
will
illustrate
how
lipid
metabolites
,
such
as
triglyceride
and
B
-
OH
-
butyrate
,
can
be
used
to
assess
relative
refueling
rate
over
very
short
time
scales
preceding
capture
.

I
will
also
discuss
the
potential
biases
introduced
by
important
covariates
and
the
influence
of
diet
on
metabolite
concentrations
.

I
will
argue
that
when
used
judiciously
and
interpreted
along
with
behavioural
and
ecological
data
,
blood
metabolite
profiling
can
provide
extremely
useful
information
not
available
by
other
means
.

A
PREDICTIVE
MODEL
OF
WETLAND
LOSS
FOR
THE
SOUTHEASTERN
UNITED

:

IMPLICATIONS
FOR
AVIAN
CONSERVATION
8/4/2008AOU

2008
Portland
,

78
Wetlands
are
crucial
for
the
reproduction
and
survival
of
many
bird
species
.

To
ensure
that
these
habitats
are
conserved
,
an
efficient
means
of
identifying
wetlands
at
risk
of
conversion
is
needed
.

We
focused
on
the
southeastern
United
States
,
where
the
rate
of
wetland
loss
in
recent
decades
has
been
especially
high
.

Using
multivariate
adaptive
regression
splines
and
the
fates
of
28,432
wetland
sites
,
we
developed
a
model
to
predict
the
risk
of
wetland
loss
.

Important
predictors
of
wetland
conversion
were
wetland
type
,
wetland
ownership
,
land
use
of
the
adjacent
landscape
,
road
density
,
and
proportions
of
the
landscape
covered
by
human
development
and
other
wetlands
.

For
five
test
datasets
(
N=2,437
sites
each

(
0.559

0.402

and

(

)
statistics
(

,
0.832
,
0.782
,
0.819
,
0.829
;
P
0.0001
)
indicated
the
model
had
general
predicative
ability
across
the
Southeast
.

Avian
conservationists
can
use
the
model
to
help
identify
wetlands
in
danger
of
conversion
,
prioritize
at
-
risk
areas
for
protection
,
and
identify
wetland
and
landscape
conditions
that
portend
wetland
conversion
.

confirmed
this

DEMOGRAPHIC
RESPONSE
OF
THE
OVENBIRD
EM

SEIURUS
AUROCAPILLA</EM
TO
EXPERIMENTAL
SELECTION

The
Ovenbird

Seiurus
aurocapilla</em
has
recently
been
identified
as
one
of
the
species
most
sensitive
to
partial
harvesting
in
deciduous
forests
of
North
America
.

However
,
many
studies
suggest
that
demographic
responses
can
not
be
inferred
from
distributional
studies
alone
.

To
determine
the
mechanisms
underlying
individual
response
to
the
harvest
treatment
,
we
monitored
banded
populations
of
Ovenbirds
before
and
after
experimental
removal
of
30
-
40
%
of
the
basal
area
of
trees
through
selection
harvesting
.

We
measured
density
,
productivity
,
return
rate
,
recruitment
,
and
age
structure
1yr
before
and
1
yr
after
harvesting
in
4
pairs
of
plots
(
1
treated
,
1
control
;
25
ha

In
the
first
year
post
harvest
,
density
and
productivity
were
40
%
lower
in
treated
sites
than
in
controls
.

The
return
rate
was
not
influenced
by
the
treatment
,
but
recruitment
rate
was
lower
in
treated
sites
64

Specifically
,
significantly
fewer
experienced
males
were
recruited
in
treated
sites
than
in
controls
90

The
results
highlight
the
importance
of
recruitment
in
population
dynamics
and
provide
data
that
could
be
integrated
in
population
viability
models
to
test
alternative
harvesting
scenarios
.

TROPICAL
HUMMINGBIRD
MOVEMENTS
IN
AGRICULTURAL
AND
FORESTED
LANDSCAPES

The
small
size
of
pollinators
has
historically
made
them
very
difficult
to
track
and
our
limited
knowledge
of
their
movements
is
largely
speculative
.

Recent
advances
in
miniaturization
of
animal
tracking
technology
have
made
direct
tracking
of
hummingbird
movements
possible
for
the
first
time
.

We
attached
tiny
radio
transmitters
(
0.25
g
)
to
20
Green
Hermits
lt;em&gt
;
Phaethornis
guy
&
lt;/em&gt
a
generalist
tropical
forest
trapliner
.

We
conducted
translocations
across
agricultural
mosaics
(
N=9
)
and
forest
translocations
(
N=10
We
found
no
significant
differences
between
homing
times
for
birds
in
forested
or
agricultural
landscapes
(
F=0.18
,
p=0.67
,
N=18

However
,
movement
paths
tended
to
be
shorter
when
moving
through
forest
(
153
70
m
,
mean
SE
)
than
agriculture
(
544
129
p=0.0167
,

N=18
Movement
paths
were
influenced
by
streams
and
paths
and
were
(
21
6.9
m
,
mean
SE
)
closer
to
streams
than
expected
(
p=0.013
,
N=
18

Our
findings
suggest
that
this
generalist
forest
hummingbird
is
capable
of
efficiently
circumventing
agricultural
matrix
to
move
between
forest
patches
.

However
,
riparian
corridors
may
be
important
in
facilitating
these
long
distance
movements

EFFECTS
OF
WIND
POWER
DEVELOPMENT
ON
THE
ECOLOGY
OF
PRAIRIE
GROUSE

The
greater
prairie
-
chicken
(
Tympanuchus
cupido
)
and
greater
sage
-
grouse
(
Centrocercus
urophasianus
)
are
obligates
of
native
grassland
and
sagebrush
(
Artemisia
spp
ecosystems
,
respectively
.

Each
species
is
an
indicator
of
these
landscapes
intact
.

Because
much
of
these
species
'
core
breeding
range
overlaps
with
large
areas
considered
optimal
for
wind
power
development
,
there
are
conservation
concerns
.

Research
has
suggested
that
population
reduction
and
loss
of
genetic
diversity
facilitates
decreases
in
reproductive
potential
.

We
review
the
deleterious
effects
of
anthropogenic
features
on
grouse
demography
,
and
develop
hypotheses
of
the
effects
of
wind
power
development
on
grouse
.

Specifically
,
we
examine
how
population
viability
is
affected
by
changes
in
lek
attendance
,
breeding
behavior
,
space
use
,
dispersal
,
and
demographic
performance
.

Analyses
of
pre
-
construction
demographic
and
genetic
data
collected
at
proposed
wind
power
developments
indicated
that
fecundity
was
markedly
low
for
greater
prairie
-
chickens
,
sub
-
populations
are
relatively
connected
with
large
effective
population
sizes
and
high
genetic
diversity
,
and
there
is
evidence
that
land
use
is
a
driving
force
in
both
population
viability
and
isolation
.

We
discuss
potential
for
future
projects
examining
the
impacts
of
energy
developments
on
prairie
grouse
populations

We
examined
the

of
two

on
Robinson

,
Chile
:
the
critically

Juan

)
and
the

To
understand
impacts
of
the
recently
arrived
continental
firecrown
on
the
endemic
firecrown
,
and
processes
underlying
ecological
relationships
,
we
examined
the
nesting
phenology
,
success
,
and
habitat
characteristics
of
both
species
.

Individual
nesting
phenology
was
similar
between
species
,
though
overall
,
the
Green
-
backed
Firecrown
nesting
period
was
longer
than
that
of
the
endemic
.

In
2007
,
as
compared
to
2006
,
both
species
had
more
active
nests
later
in
the
season
.

Daily
nest
survival
was
similar
between
species
,
though
was
different
between
years
.

Green
-
backed
Firecrown
survival
was
more
likely
when
nests
were
higher
off
the
ground
,
though
Juan
Fernandez
Firecrown
nest
success
was
not
particularly
well
predicted
by
measured
characteristics

Birds
appear
to
partition

nest
higher

THE
EFFECTS
OF
SOCIALLY
-
ENHANCED
BREEDING
DENSITIES

ON
SPRING
ARRIVAL
,
REPRODUCTIVE
SUCCESS
,
AND
SITE
FIDELITY

For
migratory
songbirds
returning
to
their
breeding
grounds
in
early
spring
,
conspecific
song
may
facilitate
territory
search
and
settlement
,
and
result
in
clustered
distributions
.

Breeding
aggregations
,
however
,
challenge
the
prevailing
assumption
of
negative
density
-
dependence
.

We
examined
territory
establishment
by
American
redstarts
in
response
to
playbacks
on
plots
with
low
or
high
redstart
density
.

Redstarts
were
significantly
attracted
to
playbacks
and
settlement
was
strongest
on
low
density
plots
,
where
space
for
additional
territories
was
greater
.

Adult
males
new
to
our
plots
were
the
primary
respondents
,
whereas
yearling
males
failed
to
respond
.

Yearlings
preferentially
settled
on
high
density
plots
,
however
,
and
arrived
substantially
later
.

We
also
evaluated
whether
reproduction
is
negatively
affected
by
higher
densities
,
either
natural
or
experimentally
increased
.

Higher
densities
had
no
significant
negative
impacts
on
nest
survival
or
site
fidelity
.

We
also
found
no
consistent
reproductive
advantages
from
socially
-
facilitated
habitat
selection
.

High
local
density
was
also
linked
to
early
spring
arrival
,
demonstrating
that
the
plot
-
level
response
we
detected
operates
as
attraction
to
individual
birds
.

The
behavioral
cues
provided
by
early
-
arriving
males
may
help
explain
breeding
distributions
across
the
landscape
.

BROOD
PARASITES
AND
THE
EVOLUTION
OF
IMMUNITY

Increased
exposure
to
a
parasite
heightens
selection
for
a
stronger
immune
defense
,
and
increased
exposure
to
diverse
parasites
strengthens
broader
selection
on
the
immune
system
.

The
brown
-
headed
cowbird
(
Molothrus
ater
)
constitutes
a
useful
model
organism
for
investigating
how
heightened
exposure
to
disease
affects
evolution
of
immunity
.

This
cowbird
is
a
generalist
that

parasitizes
200
+
songbird
species
,
so
nestling
cowbirds
are
exposed
to
an
unusual
diversity
of
pathogens
through
intimate
association
with
their
diverse
host
parents
.

We
previously
showed
that
brown
-
headed
cowbirds
have
exceptional
immune
defenses
against
three
serious
avian
viruses
:
West
Nile
virus
,
Western
equine

,
and
St.

We
have
now
expanded
our
investigation
to
test
whether
other
cowbird
species
also
show
greater
disease
resistance
than
non
-
parasitic
blackbirds

(
Icteridae
We
confirmed
that
Shiny
(
M.
bonariensis
)
and
Bronzed
Cowbird
(
M.
aeneus
)
also
demonstrate
greater
immunity
against
these
viruses
.

We
measured
relative
immunity
by
the
principal
indicators
of
resistance
to
serious
pathogens
:
greater
resistance
to
infection
,
lower
viremia
and
lower
mortality
when
infected
,
and
fewer
days
required
to
recover
from
infection
.

These
three
cowbird
species
are
all
generalists
that
parasitize
multiple
songbird
species
,
although
they
differ
in
number
and
diversity
of
species
parasitized
,
differences
that
may
be
reflected
in
the
degree
of
their
disease
resistance
.

While
the
brown
-
headed
cowbird
is
native
to
North
America
,
shiny
and
bronzed
cowbirds
are
tropical
species
that
have
recently
invaded
,
and
their
tropical
origin
may
also
contribute
to
differences
in
their
immune
systems
.

ROLES
OF
SCARCITY
AND
PLENTY
IN
THE
BIOLOGY
OF
CROSSBILLS

:
IS
EVERYTHING
WE
THINK

WE
KNOW
ABOUT
CROSSBILLS
WRONG
?

Everything
about
the
biology
of
red
crossbills
em
>

Loxia
curvirostra</em
including
temporally
opportunistic
reproduction
,
nomadism
,
and
evolution
of
diverse
morphologies
has
been
presumed
to
reflect
selection
based
on
spatially
and
temporally
unreliable
,
and
generally
poor
,
food
resources
.

Here
we
suggest
an
alternative
hypothesis
that
crossbills
are
"
cream
skimmers
primarily
adapted
to
exploit
riches
,
not
to
cope
with
scarcity
.

We
present
evidence
based
on
20
+
years
of
field
and
laboratory
studies
that
we
feel
supports
this
alternative
viewpoint
.

Specifically
,
we
argue
that
timing
of
reproduction
,
molt
,
and
migration
in
crossbills
are
more
consistent
with
adaptation
to
riches
than
to
scarcity
.

Even
evolution
of
diverse
morphologies
in
the
different
nomadic
crossbill
ecotypes
may
be
as
consistent
with
selection
based
on
efficiency
of
exploitation
of
abundance
(
selection
operating
through
differential
reproductive
success
)
as
with
selection
based
on
ability
to
cope
with
scarcity
(
selection
operating
through
differential
survival

We
argue
that
these
two
alternatives
require
further
careful
scrutiny
,
suggest
specific
kinds
of
data
that
should
be
collected
to
evaluate
them
,
and
discuss
the
unique
implications
of
nomadism
for
evolution
of
physiology
,
morphology
and
behavior
generally

GENETICS
AND
THE
ENDANGERED
SPECIES
ACT
:
RECONCILING
SCIENCE
AND
POLICY
Molecular
markers
are
a
key
resource
in
identifying
taxa
for
enforcement
of
laws
such
as
the
Endangered
Species
Act
,
Convention
on
International
Trade
of
Endangered
Species
,
and
the
Migratory
Bird
Treaty
Act
.

They
are
particularly
informative
when
species
or
subspecies
identity
is
difficult
to
discern
via
morphology
.

For
example
,
ESA
-
listed
Northern
Spotted
Owls
(
Strix
occidentalis
caurina
)
and
Mexican
Spotted
Owls
(
S.
o.

)
can
not
be
easily
differentiated
in
hand
from
non
-
ESA
protected
California
Spotted
Owls
(
S.
o.
occidentalis

Given
overlap
in
their
ranges
,
molecular
marker
evidence
can
mean
the
difference
between
prosecution
and
exoneration
under
the
ESA
and
Migratory
Bird
Treaty
Act
.

More
complicated
is
the
case
of
hybridization
between
ESA
-
listed
Spotted
Owls
and
invading
Barred
Owls
(
S.
varia
While
molecular
markers
can
identify
the
origin
of
these
individuals
,
lack
of
law
,
regulation
,
or
policy
to
deal
with
hybrids
leaves
law
enforcement
personnel
in
a
dilemma
.

Until
a
formal
hybrid
policy
is
developed
and
applied
by
the
USFWS
,
we
suggest
that
using
section
4(e
)
of
the

clause
may
be
helpful
in
some
situations

WHAT
'S
IN
A
NAME
:

GENETICS
AND
THE
ENDANGERED
SPECIES
ACT
Scientific
debate
over
identification
of
taxa
below
the
species
level
has
continued
for
centuries
.

This
issue
can
be
especially
problematic
for
avian
species
as
dispersal
is
often
orders
of
magnitude
greater
than
other
vertebrates
,
leaving
differences
among
groups
proportionately
smaller
.

Thus
,
identification
of
avian
subspecific
units
can
be
difficult
and
sometimes
arguable
.

While
the
debate
lingers
,
decisions
,
often
with
millions
of
dollars
resting
on
the
outcome
,
are
regularly
made
by
U.S.
Fish
and
Wildlife
Service
(
USFWS
)
on
whether
to
list
a
particular
taxonomic
entity
under
the
U.S.
Endangered
Species
Act
(
ESA

With
no
formal
policy
or
guidelines
for
defining
subspecies
,
USFWS
is
left
in
a
bind
as
to
how
to
proceed
.

The
outcome
does
not
benefit
endangered
species
.

Here
we
review
cases
where
subspecific
issues
have
arisen
for
potential
or
ESA
-
listed
avian
taxa
and
how
they
could
be
better
handled
if
scientists
followed
a
series
of
proposed
guidelines
for
taxonomic
identification
.

Ultimately
,
conservation
of
many
avian
species
rests
on
the
willingness
of
taxonomists
to
follow
consistent
guidelines
in
their
definitions
and
be
more
communicative
with
USFWS

PATTERNS
OF
GENE

FLOW
IN
TROPICAL
SEABIRDS
:
COMPARATIVE
DATA
FROM
MAGNIFICENT
FRIGATEBIRDS
AND
BROWN
BOOBIES

Many
tropical
seabirds
exhibit
significant
size
variation
across
their
ranges
,
some
even
within
described
subspecies
.

In
fact
,
despite
their
wide
roaming
behavior
and
high
dispersal
potential
,
genetic
and
banding
studies
have
revealed
strong
philopatry
in
many
seabirds
.

Besides
intrinsic
homing
mechanisms
,
extrinsic
barriers
may
limit
gene
flow
,
including
static
geological
barriers
and
dynamic
oceanic
barriers
.

Species
-
specific
life
history
traits
should
however
lead
to
different
signatures
in
different
species
.

We
studied
genetic
variation
in
Caribbean
and
Pacific
populations
of
the
Brown
Booby
(
Sula
leucogaster
an
inshore
feeder
,
and
the
Magnificent
Frigatebird
(
Fregata
magnificens
a
far
ranging
species
.

Their
contrasting
phylogeographic
patterns
may
reflect
a
combination
of
the
species
'
feeding
habits
,
energetic
expenditures
,
and
responses
to
physical
and/or
oceanographic
barriers
.

Our
findings
are
consistent
with
the
notion
that
species
that
forage
near
colonies
show
more
differentiation
among
populations
,
which
may
further
extend
to
limited
interactions
among
populations
during
the
non
-
breeding
season
.

Other
factors
influencing
gene
flow
patterns
will
be
discussed
,
as
well
as
conservation
implications
;
in
past
decades
colonies
in
many
regions
have
experienced
declines
or
extinction
.

patterns
in

Odontophorus

Black

Wood
-
Quail
are
restricted
to
the
remaining
highland
forest
of
Costa
Rica
and
deforestation
has
resulted
in
a
reduction
in
species

wide
population
size
as
well
as
fragmentation
into
local

.

Relatedness
data
indicated
that

more
closely

than
individuals

providing
support
for
the

.

Nevertheless
,
we
also
found
evidence
for
both

individuals
living
within
the
same
groups
,
suggesting
that
group
structure
is
more
complex
than

.

Spatial
autocorrelation
revealed
that
dispersal
is
restricted
in
both

although
perhaps
to
a
lesser
extent
in

.

We
conclude
that

may
have
an
increased

if
the

USE
OF
MERCURY
TO
RECOGNIZE
FLOATERS
IN
A
TREE
SWALLOW
POPULATION

In
many
species
of
birds
,
floaters
,
a
non
-
breeding
subset
of
the
population
,
spend
the
breeding
season
in
proximity
to
the
breeding
grounds
without
nesting
.

Often
,
younger
or
lower
quality
birds
act
as
floaters
and
subsequently
recruit
into
resident
breeding
populations
.

However
,
floaters
are
difficult
to
study
and
most
documentation
has
been
through
experimental
manipulation
of
nest
sites
or
removal
of
residents
.

Here
,
we
show
unequivocal
recruitment
of
floating
Tree
Swallows

Tachycineta
bicolor</em
into
a
breeding
population
without
removal
of
breeders
.

In
2005
,
a
nest
box
trail
was
established
along
the
South
River
,
VA
to
monitor
breeding
Tree
Swallows
exposed
to
aquatic
mercury
.

Because
feather
mercury
levels
reflect
exposure
to
mercury
during
the
previous
breeding
season
,
we
were
able
to
use
mercury
as
a
tracer
to
detect
prior
occupancy
of
the
contaminated
nesting
area
by
firsttime
breeders
.

Not
only
did
this
mercury
tracer
allow
us
to
document
the
recruitment
of
floaters

the

population

compared
to

NEW
HARNESS
TECHNIQUE
FOR
MOUNTING
RADIO
TRANSMITTERS

Radio
telemetry
has
been
a
tool
in
ecological
research
for
several
decades
.

Resolution
of
spatial
and
temporal
habitat
use
using
telemetry
is
often
unmatched
by
any
other
technique
.

Telemetry
technology
has
evolved
to
the
present
state
in
which
transmitters
are
now
manufactured
for
use
on
birds
weighing
as
little
as
9.5
g
(
transmitter
weight

We
describe
a
simple
leg
harness
that
can
be
made
using
a
single
length
of
cotton
string
by
tying
it
into
a
double
slip
knot
and
tightening
a
loop
around
each
leg
,
and
then
adhering
the
transmitter
to
the
single
knot
on
the
back
of
the
bird
using
epoxy
.

The
string
biodegrades
insuring
the
transmitter
falls
off
after
no
more
than
6
-
8
wks
.

We
have
successfully
used
this
harness
on
three
species
of
passerines
of
different
sizes
and
on
both
fledglings
and
adults

POLLUTANTS
IN
FOREST
FOOD

ACID
RAIN
,
MERCURY
,
AND
FOREST
BIRDS

Much
of
the
forest
habitat
used
by
breeding
birds
in
rural
New
York
receives
atmospheric
deposition
of
acid
ions
and
mercury
.

Wet
acid
precipitation
can
lead
to
declines
in
the
abundance
and
size
of
calcium
-
rich
invertebrates
that
may
provide
calcium
supplements
needed
by
many
breeding
birds
.

These
invertebrates
may
also
be
sources
of
mercury
,
derived
from
soil
and
leaf
litter
,
when
eaten
by
birds
while
laying
,
or
when
fed
to
growing
nestlings
.

We
address
the
total
mercury
concentration
in
soil
,
living
leaves
,
leaf
litter
,
invertebrates
,
and
in
songbirds
'
blood
and
feathers
.

Both
soil
mercury
and
the
mercury
content
of
leaflitter
varies
with
soil
acidity
and
calcium
content
.

Millipede
mercury
content
varies
with
soil
acidity
and
negatively
with
millipede
mass
.

Mercury
content
did
not
differ
by
invertebrate
taxon
,
but
millipedes
,
slugs
,
and
beetles
may
provide
large
doses
of
mercury
to
birds
.

Blood
calcium
levels
were
negatively
correlated
with
the
mercury
levels
in
blood
and
feathers
of
Red
-
eyed
Vireos
.

Blood
calcium
varied
significantly
by
region
,
although
mercury
did
not
.

We
discuss
these
findings
and
future
work

THE
MYSTERY
OF
THE
LONG
-
BEAK
SYNDROME

Large
numbers
of
wild
birds
are
developing
gross
beak
deformities
and
the
cause
is
still
a
mystery
.

We
have
documented
more
than
2,500
birds
of
102
species
exhibiting
maxillary
and
mandibular
overgrowth
of
the
keratin
layer
with
varying
degrees
of
abnormal
curvature
and
crossing
.

Parids
,
corvids
,
and
raptors
are
the
most
frequently
reported
birds
with
such
deformities
,
but
a
wide
variety
of
other
taxa
is
also
afflicted
.

The
reports
have
been
concentrated
in
Alaska
and
the
Pacific
Northwest
,
although
birds
with
similarly
deformed
beaks
have
been
reported
from
across
North
America
and
Europe
.

Beak
deformities
cause
difficulties
in
feeding
and
preening
,
resulting
in
increased
rates
of
mortality
.

Deformities
affect
both
males
and
females
but
prevalence
appears
higher
among
adult
birds
.

Testing
of
Black
-
capped
Chickadees
,
the
species
with
the
highest
reported
rate
,
has
revealed
no
evidence
yet
of
disease
,
parasites
,
or
contaminants
as
the
cause
.

Current
research
is
using
a
comparative
cross
-
species
approach
at
multiple
levels
.

We
are
soliciting
further
observations
of
the
long
-
beak
syndrome
and
welcome
ideas
on
what
might
be
causing
it
.

Previous
studies
have
generated
testable
hypotheses
concerning

relationships
within
this

.

However
,
molecular
data
have
yet
to
inform
our
knowledge
of
the
degree
of
divergence
of
Orange

populations
on
a
species

wide
level
.

To
address
this
question
,
we
analyzed
two
mtDNA
genes
(
ND2
,
ATP6
)
and
10
polymorphic
microsatellite
markers
,
which
were
developed
from
<

V.
celata</em

The
data
set
included
133
individuals
from
17
populations
representing
all
four
subspecies
.

These
data
reveal
that
population
divergences
are
relatively
recent
,
but
structured
.

Subspecies
mostly
group
into
different
clusters
,
although
lineage
sorting
is
incomplete
.

Phenotypic
differences
between
subspecies
appear
to
be
recently
derived
.

We
will
examine
patterns
of
colonization
and
will
discuss
whether
sharing
of
haplotypes
is
ancestral
or
the
result
of
ongoing
gene
flow
.

is
increasingly
affected
by
energy

.

An
understanding
of
the
response
of
sage

to
disturbances
,
particularly
the
types
of
disturbance
and
scales
at
which
they
respond
,
is
critical
to
understanding
how
to
mitigate
their
effects
.

We
estimated

round
habitat
use
from
pellet
surveys
conducted
at

We
developed
a
spatially

.

In
preliminary

,
habitat
factors
important
for

included
sagebrush
quantity
and

and
topographic
ruggedness
;
human

,
such

highlight
the
importance
to

If
environmental
conditions
change
,
then
populations
at
distribution
margins
should
show
evidence
of
expansion
or
contraction
in
association
with
that
change
.

We
tested
for
distributional
shifts
along
an
arid
elevation
gradient
in
southern
California
that
is
undergoing
rapid
climate
change
.

Increasing
temperatures
and
aridity
in
this

(
locally
,
mean
maximum
temperature
in
the
desert
has
increased
by
3.8
C
since
1962
)
are
expected
to
cause
upward
shifts
in
elevational
distributions
.

Over
the
past
26
years
,
five
species
(
out
of
28
tested
)
showed
statistically
significant
distribution
shifts
,
all
upward
in

These

which
would
have

THE
PRESENCE
OF
FEATHER
MITES
ALTERS

THE
COMPOSITION
OF
PREEN

SECRETIONS
OF
HOUSE

Previous
study
in
our
lab
has
shown
that
the
mite
numbers
paralleled
amounts
of
preen
gland
secretions
in
House
Finches
.

Also
,
when
the
secretions
peaked
,
the
number
of
components
in
the
secretion
also
increased
.

We
conducted
manipulative
experiments
in
two
walk
-
in
aviaries
using
House
Sparrows
to
understand
the
relation
between
secretions
and
mites
.

We
released
wild
-
caught
birds
with
higher
number
20
)
of
mites
in
aviary
1
and
birds
with
lower
number
of
mites
20
)
that
were
treated
with
avermectin
to
kill
any
mites
present
,
in
aviary
2
.

We
introduced
ten
birds
to
each
cage
that
had
no
mites
as
controls
.

We
monitored
the
mites
and
secretions
on
these
birds
for
two
months
.

The
secretions
at
the
beginning
of
the
experiments
were
very
similar
for
both
groups
of
birds
.

At
the
end
of
the
experiments
,
the
secretions
of
two
groups
showed
significant
differences
in
type
of
components
.

Also
,
the
mite
numbers
on
birds
increased
in
aviary
1
,
most
of
the
control
birds
showed
presence
of
at
least
some
mites
after
two
months
.

Thus
,
we
conclude
that
the
presence
of
mites
induce
production
of
additional
components
in
the
secretions
.

ECOLOGICAL

ANTHROPOGENIC
FACTORS
INFLUENCING
THE
DISTRIBUTION
AND
TRANSMISSION
OF
WEST
NILE
VIRUS
IN
VECTOR
AND
HOST
POPULATIONS

Although
several
studies
suggest
a
close
relationship
between
various
factors
and
the
emergence
and
proliferation
of
infectious
diseases
,
there
is
little
evidence
demonstrating
the
exact
effects
of
environmental
conditions
on
the
life
history
of
either
hosts
or
vectors
of
specific
viruses
.

We
examined
the
spatial
and
temporal
patterns
of
West
Nile
virus
(
WNV
)
in
mosquito
and
avian
hosts
,
and
how
these
patterns
change
with
ecological
conditions
,
over
the
course
of
several
vector
/
host
breeding
seasons
.

By
documenting
the
occurrence
of
a
widespread
,
recently
introduced
virus
in
vector
and
host
populations
,
and
mapping
the
prevalence
of
this
disease
using
the
most
recent
and
advanced
remote
sensing
and
bioclimatic
data
,
we
determined
environmental
correlates
of
WNV
in
an
anthropogenically
-
altered
ecological
setting
.

This
multidisciplinary
approach
allows
for
an
understanding
of
how
ecological
changes
affect
arbovirus
infection
and
distribution
,
and
helps
determine
the
impact
of
WNV
on
avian
,
and
subsequently
mammalian
,
hosts
.

By
determining
ecological
correlates
of
disease
prevalence
,
we
are
able
to
predict
how
climate
change
may
affect
the
future
impact
of
West
Nile
virus
on
host
populations
.

THE

ADDRESS
SEASONAL
DECLINE
IN

A

PASSERINE
Reproductive

of

declines

.

Seasonal
decreases
in
food
quantity
and/or
quality
have
been
suggested
as
primary
causes
of
this
decline
,
yet
few
studies
have
adequately
tested
food
hypotheses
.

We
fed

Tachycineta

nestlings
at
St.

every
day
from

post

using
a
mixture
of
ground
mealworms
,
calcium
,
and
water
.

External
morphometric
measurements
were
taken
every
other
day
from
days
4
-

.

A
sub
-
sample
of
chicks
was
collected
16
days
post
hatch
for
internal
morphometric
measurements
.

Supplemental
feeding
had
no
effect
on
the
growth
rates
of
mass
,
or
primary
feather

head

bill
lengths
.

Additionally
,
body
mass
at
day
16
did
not
differ
between
supplemented
and
control
nestlings
at
either
site
.

Supplemental
feeding
had
no
impact
on
water
or
fat
contents
of
leg
muscles
,
or
spleen
and
liver
masses
of
nestlings
.

Although
these
results
could
indicate
that
food
availability
does
not
limit
nestling
size
or
growth
,
a
plausible
alternative
explanation
is
that
costs
of
force
-
feeding
chicks
did
not
outweigh
benefits
of
providing
supplemental
food
.

was
low
for

Without

,
the
number

would
decline
annually
by
2

However
,
recruitment

Our

because
of

REPEATABILITY

COUNTS
IN
GRAY
CATBIRDS

Several
recent
studies
call
into
question
the
reliability
of
hematocrit
as
a
measure
of
physiological
condition
given
that
there
are
many
factors
that
influence
hematocrit
.

We
examined
the
repeatability
of
hematocrit
in
Gray
Catbirds
<

Dumetella

arriving
at
a
breeding
site

to
determine
if
it
was
a
consistent
trait
of
individual
birds
.

Hematocrit
was
significantly
repeatable
between
years
for
samples
taken
from
birds
on
their
first
capture
in
2006
and
2007
,
but
was
not
repeatable
within
year
from
first
to
second
capture
.

We
also
examined
repeatability
of
lymphocyte
,
heterophil
and
total
white
blood
cell
counts
but
did
not
find
these
measures
to
be
repeatable
.

In
addition
to
being
consistent
between
years
,
hematocrit
upon
first
capture
was
positively
related
to
fat
score
,
suggesting
that
in

hematocrit
may
be
a
reasonable
indicator
of

CONSIDERATIONS

The
enormous
population
of

domestic
cats
in
the
U.S.
represents
a
threat
to
native

Yet

urge
the

as
an
effective

But
the
reabandoning

of
large
numbers
of

in
the

conflicts
with
federal

laws
designed

.

In

the

violates
many

that
are

MORPHOMETRIC
INDICES
OF
BODY
CONDITION
:

PITFALLS
AND
PROSPECTS
Animal
ecologists
,
particularly
those
who
study
fish
or
birds
,
have
made
widespread
use
of
morphologically
based
indices
of
condition
.

Condition
indices
are
typically
based
either
on
ratios
(
e.g
mass
/
wing
chord
)
or
on
residuals
(
e.g
residuals
from
regression
of
mass
on
some
measure
of
body
length

The
relative
merits
(
e.g
size
independence
or
not
)
of
these
various
indices
have
been
debated
vigorously
,
but
ultimately
which
index
is
best
is
an
empirical
question
.

Some
condition
indices
are
well
correlated
with
what
the
investigator
seeks
to
measure
,
and
others
are
not
.

In
the
context
of
data
from
a
recently
completed
study
,
we
discuss
the
following
questions
.

How
should
condition
be
defined
?

What
are
the
best
morphometric
indicators
of
fat
content
(
one
common
measure
of
condition
Should
condition
indices
be
used
at
all
or
is
regression
of
mass
on
multiple
morphometric
indicators
a
better
approach
?

We
recommend
(
1
)
that
condition
should
be
defined
unambigously
2
)
that
condition
indices
only
be
used
if
they
have
been
appropriately
validated
,
and
(
3
)
that
well
formulated
regression
models
should
replace
the
use
of
condition
indices
wherever
possible
.

EM

WILSONIA
PUSILLA</EM

We

inter
-
individual
variation
in
total
migration
distance
within
a
species
affects
stopover
duration
,
fuel
stores
and

rate
.

The
Wilson
's
Warbler
is
a
leapfrog
migrant
passerine
that
winters
in
Central
America
and
breeds
throughout
North
America
.

We
captured
birds
in
the
spring
and
fall
of
2006
during
passage
through
a
desert
stopover
site
in
southern
Arizona
.

Total
migration
distance
of
individuals
was
assessed
using
deuterium
ratio
of
feathers
,
stopover
duration
was
estimated
using
mark
recapture
analysis
of
color
-
banded
birds
,
and
relative
refueling
rate
was
measured
using
plasma
metabolite
analysis
.

Compared
to
short
-
distance
migrant
individuals
,
longer
-
distance
migrants
passed
through
later
during
spring
migration
,
and
had
shorter
minimum
lengths
of
stay
,
larger
fuel
stores
and
a
higher
rate
of
refueling
.

During
autumn
,
longer
-
distance
migrants
passed
through
later
,
but
there
was
little
variation
in
minimum
length
of
stay
.

Total
migration
distance
in
autumn
did
not
affect
fuel
stores
,
however
,
longerdistance
migrants
refueled
at
a
higher
rate
.

Our

demonstrates
the
power
of
combining
stable
isotope

to

we
are
conducting

areas
are
exposed
to
an
hour
of
acute
motorcycle
exposure
to
simulate

indicate
that

than
females
,
and
that
both

HOW
DOES
FORAGING
HABITAT
RESTORATION
AFFECT
PIPING
PLOVER
REPRODUCTION
?

Many
species
that
breed
or
winter
along
the
North
American
coasts
are
threatened
or
endangered
as
result
of
habitat
loss
and
degradation
.

As
humans
manipulate
the
coastline
,
projects
that
attempt
to
restore
&
quot;natural&quot
;
habitats
may
benefit
declining
species
.

Several
studies
have
indicated
the
importance
of
moist
substrate
foraging
habitat
for
Piping
Plover
lt;em&gt;Charadrius
melodus&lt;/em&gt
breeding
success
.

At
Jones
Beach
State
Park
,
on
the
south
shore
of
Long
Island
,
New
York
,
a
0.49
ha
restoration
project
provided
foraging
habitat
for
breeding
Piping
Plovers
from
2002
to
2005
.

We
examined
whether
the
restoration
affected
Piping
Plover
breeding
populations
,
productivity
,
and
overall
chick
production
.

We
found
a
positive
relationship
between
the
number
of
Piping
Plover
chicks
produced
per
year
and
habitat
restoration
.

However
,
the
restoration
did
not
significantly
increase
the
number
of
plover
pairs
breeding
at
Jones
Beach
.

Despite
the
relatively
small
size
of
the
project
,
there
were
measurable
effects
,
and
the
results
from
this
study
indicate
that
the
restoration
of
foraging
habitat
has
potential
for
a
positive
impact
on
species
recovery
.

THE
EFFECT
OF
SHIFTING
MOTIVATION
ON
VEERY
ACOUSTIC
CUES
.

Temporal
and
spectral
properties
of
avian
vocalizations
often
change
in
relation
to
the
shifting
motivation
of
the
signaler
.

I
investigated
how
the
temporal
and
structural
properties
of
Veery
em
>

Catharus
fuscescens</em
calls
(
call
rate
,
amplitude
,
frequency
,
duration
)
changed
in
relation
to
the
threat
of
nest
predation
in
three
contexts
:
an
approaching
threat
;
increasing
parental
investment
in
the
current
nesting
cycle
;
and
progression
of
the
nesting
season
.

In
all
contexts
there
were
significant
directional
effects
on
call
rate
and
amplitude
.

The
most
reliable
cue
was
the
increase
in
amplitude
.

The
progression
of
the
nesting
cycle
differs
from
the
progression
of
the
nesting
season
because
it
incorporates
the
emergence
of
nestlings
as
assessors
.

The
progression
of
the
nesting
cycle
changed
frequency
and
duration
such
that
the
effect
on
vocalizing
was
counter
to
that
of
a
progressing
nesting
season
.

Veeries
emphasized
acoustic
structures
appropriate
for
long
-
distance
communication
prior
to
the
emergence
of
nestlings
and
temporal
cues
appropriate
for
short
-
distance
communication
after
the
emergence
of
nestlings
.

Thus
,
propagation
of
Veery
acoustic
cues
differed
depending
on
signaler
motivation
and
the
location
of
probable
assessors
.

A
RESOURCE
FOR
EVALUATING
BIRD
MIGRATION
.

NEXRAD
Weather
Surveillance
Radar
is
a
valuable
tool
for
the
study
of
bird
migration
.

We
assembled
six
years
of
data
from
the
NOAA
National
Climatic
Data
Center
archives
for
NEXRAD
sites
located
along
the
Upper
Mississippi
River
including
Wisconsin
,
Minnesota
,
Iowa
,
Illinois
,
and
Missouri
and
generated
time
-
series
mosaics
of
the
radar
products
.

These
animations
are
useful
for
identifying
and
summarizing
timing
,
locations
,
weather
influences
,
and
possibly
,
the
intensity
of
migration
events
.

Understanding
the
behavior
,
timing
and
pathways
of
migrating
birds
is
essential
to
help
minimize
the
impact
of
wind
farms
and
other
aerial
obstructions
on
migrating
bird
populations
and
to
develop
guidance
for
stopover
habitat
restoration
.

Our
effort
complements
on
-
going
work
using
NEXRAD
technology
in
combination
with
ground
transects
,
banding
stations
,
and
radio
telemetry
to
aid
in
exploring
bird
migration
patterns
and
habitat
use
.

The
time
-
series
animation
of
migration
is
an
innovative
resource
for
land
and
wildlife
managers
,
wind
power
and
communications
industry
managers
,
and
other
scientists
for
demonstrating
or
predicting
when
,
where
,
and
how
migrating
birds
might
be
most
vulnerable
to
development

highly
adaptable
and
becoming
increasingly
abundant
in

.

Living
in
such
close

to
humans
has
raised
several
issues
requiring
further
attention
and
management
1

Osprey

,
and
(

)
they
nest

(
increasing
risk
of
Osprey
-
aircraft

An
obligate
fish
-
eater
and
historically
impacted
by
DDT
and
other
contaminants
,
the
Osprey
was
instrumental
in
focusing
attention
on
pollution
issues
.

Now
,
with
most
Osprey
populations
recovered
from
legacy
contaminants
,
the
species
is
again
playing
an
important
role
in
evaluating
emerging

.

Several
life
history
traits
make
the
Osprey
especially
appealing
for
their
recent
proposed
role
as
a
"
worldwide
sentinel
species
"
for
assessing
and
monitoring
environmental
contamination
in
large
rivers
,
lakes
,
reservoirs
and
estuaries
.

Creative
remedial
measures
(
many
underway
)
combining
effective
management

will
provide
a

INCUBATION
COSTS
IN
WOOD
DUCKS
:

AN
EXPERIMENTAL
STUDY
Incubation
can
be
an
important
reproductive
cost
in
birds
.

Optimal
growth
and
development
of
embryos
takes
place
within
a
rather
narrow
range
of
incubation
temperatures
,
and
parents
must
balance
the
competing
demands
of
maintaining
good
body
condition
while
caring
for
developing
eggs
.

Time
and
energy
demands
can
be
especially
important
for
uniparental
incubators
.

Recent
experimental
studies
have
shown
that
incubation
costs
can
limit
both
current
and
future
reproductive
success
.

In
this
study
,
we
manipulated
the
incubation
cost
of
female
Wood
Ducks
(
Aix
sponsa
;
n
77
)
by
shortening
and
lengthening
incubation
periods
.

We
tested
the
effects
of
this
manipulation
on
body
mass
dynamics
of
incubating
females
,
incubation
behavior
(
number
of
recesses
and
constancy
and
apparent
survival
of
females
to
the
next
breeding
season
.

Median
incubation
period
was
32
days
(
range
23
-
40
d
and
there
was
a
weak
negative
relationship
between
incubation
period
and
the
body
condition
of
females
at
the
end
of
incubation
.

We
also
will
report
whether
manipulation
of
incubation
costs
influenced
incubation
behavior
and
survival
of
females
to
the
next
breeding
season
.

USING
BAGGED
DECISION

The
California
Avian

Center
(
CADC
)
manages
and
federates
avian
and
ecosystem
data
within
California
,
including
over
1
million
point
count
observations
collected
by
trained
field
biologists
and
combines
datasets
from
a
large
number
of
organizations
.

CADC
also
provides
powerful
tools
to
attribute
each
of
these
observations
with
over
50
landscape
covariates
at
a
number
of
spatial
scales
.

These
data
were
collected
throughout
the
state
of
California
and
provide
a
robust
dataset
to
help
understand
the
important
factors
determining
species
abundance
.

Using
decision
tree
programs
developed
in
collaboration
with
Cornell
Lab
of
Ornithology
we
investigate
important
species
habitat
relationships
on
over
25
avian
species
within
the
state
of
California
.

Specifically
,
we
provide
results
on
the
influence
of
the
spatial
scale
on
habitat
and
landscape
correlates
among
species
and
use
this
information
to
predict
species
abundance
across
a
large
landscape
(
e.g.
state
of
California

The
species
analyzed
differ
significantly
in
abundance
and
specific
habitat
dependencies
.

In
this
presentation
,
we
also
examine
how
the
performance
of
decision

models
varies
depending
on

single

suggesting
the
difference
may
be
driven
by

than
inherent
size
.

The
size
of
the
red
crown
patch
unique
to
juvenile
males
showed
no
relationship
to
social
rank
.

Male
nestlings
in
higher
condition
relative
to
their
male
siblings
were
socially
dominant
as
fledglings
and
these
males
were
more
likely
to
delay
dispersal
and
over
winter
at
the
natal
site
.

This
pattern
differs
from
that
reported
for
other
avian
species
in
which
dominant
individuals
disperse
earlier
.

In
Red

the
dominant
juveniles
choose
to
delay
dispersal
and
possibly
also
delay
reproduction
in
favor
of

COLORFUL
PLUMAGE

AS
A
SIGNAL
OF
SPECIES

RECONSIDERATION
OF

A
NEGLECTED

HYPOTHESIS
We
contrasted
three
predictions
of
sexual
selection
versus
species
recognition
hypotheses
for
the
function
of
speculum
coloration
in
Mallards
(

Anas
platyrhynchos
First
,
we
predicted
that
if
speculum
coloration
functions
as
a
signal
of
male
quality
,
it
should
be
sexually
dimorphic
.

Second
,
we
predicted
that
if
speculum
coloration
is
sexually
selected
then
variation
should
be
larger
than
in
either
the
coloration
of
non
-
iridescent
feathers
or
feather
length
.

If
speculum
coloration
is
used
in
species
recognition
,
it
should
be
no
more
variable
than
these
other
traits
.

Third
,
we
predicted
that
if
iridescent
speculum
coloration
is
a
signal
of
quality
,
then
color
expression
should
be
negatively
correlated
with
parasite
load
but
if
speculum
coloration
is
a
signal
of
species
identity
then
there
should
be
no
effect
of
parasites
.

We
found
that
specula
of
Mallards
is
not
sexually
dichromatic
,
that
iridescent
speculum
coloration
was
not
more
variable
than
the
color
of
non
-
iridescent
feathers
,
and
that
speculum
coloration
was
not
correlated
with
blood
parasites
at
the
time
of
molt
.

Our
observations
suggest
that
speculum
coloration
in
mallards
may
serve
as
signal
of
species
identity

changed

THE
ROLE
OF
LANDSCAPE
AND
FOREST
STRUCTURE
VARIABLES
.

Models
of
habitat
relationships
describe
important
habitat
components
that
bird
species
use
to
select
suitable
breeding
habitat
.

These
habitat
components
can
be
quantified
at
different
spatial
scales
to
describe
the
habitat
selection
process
at
different
spatial
scales
.

We
used
occupancy
analysis
,
which
incorporated
detection
probabilities
,
to
develop
habitat
relationship
models
based
on
both
site
-
level
and
mapped
characteristics
such
as
land
cover
.

We
developed
a
set
of
competing
hypotheses
to
determine
the
importance
of
landscape
scale
or
site
level
forest
structure
variables
.

Included
in
the
model
set
were
models
that
combined
landscape
scale
and
site
level
characteristics
to
examine
whether
described
habitat
relationships
were
more
accurate
with
both
sets
of
variables
combined
.

We
conducted
228
point
counts
on
a
138km2
area
in
the
Cumberland
Plateau
Region
of
Alabama
.

Our
results
show
that
models
with
a
combination
of
variables
quantified
from
different
scales
were
selected
by
AIC
instead
of
models
that
only
contained
one
set
of
variables
.

These
results
are
an
important
contribution
to
our
ability
to
use
habitat
relationship
models
for
regional
conservation
planning

When

SMALL

SCALE
SPATIAL
VARIATION
IN
THE
IMPACTS
OF
WEST
NILE
DISEASE
ON
BIRD
ABUNDANCES

Following
the
emergence
of
West
Nile
disease
in
North
America
,
populations
of
several
species
of
birds
declined
,
some
substantially
.

Given
suggestions
in
the
literature
about
the
patchy
distribution
of
outbreaks
of
West
Nile
disease
,
we
looked
for
small
-
scale
variation
in
the
magnitudes
of
declines
of
several
common
and
resident
bird
species
,
using
winter
count
data
from
Project
FeederWatch
.

Data
came
from
the
lower
Great
Lakes
region
,
an
area
that
has
experienced
repeated
outbreaks
of
West
Nile
disease
.

We
found
very
fine
scale
variation
in
the
magnitudes
of
declines
of
wintering
bird
,
suggesting
that
outbreaks
of
West
Nile
disease
have
been
very
patchy
and
thus
that
local
environmental
conditions
are
controlling
the
probability
of
disease
outbreaks
.

Further
analyses
suggested
environmental
features
that
are
related
to
the
observed
patchy
distribution
of
declines
in
bird
abundance
that
we
observed
.

HOW
DO
BIRDS
ON
STOPOVER

WHEN
TO
LEAVE
?

Cues
influencing
decisions
to
resume
migration
are
not
well
understood
.

The
present
objective
was
to
look
at
how
mass
and
fat
influence
migratory
motivation
.

Dark
-
eyed
juncos
,
Junco
hyemalis
,
experienced
different
food
treatments
while
monitored
for
fall
migratory
activity
,
Zugunruhe
,
for
six
weeks
in
captivity
.

Juncos
restricted
to
a
non
-
migratory
food
intake
of
4
g
/
day
throughout
the
period
did
not
gain
mass
or
fat
,
and
showed
little
or
no
Zugunruhe
compared
to
juncos
allowed
to
feed
ad
libitum
.

Juncos
that
experienced
four
repeated
periods
(
8
-
10
days
)
of
food
limitation
(
4
g
/
day
)
following
similar
periods
of
ad
libitum
feeding
expressed
a
saw
-
tooth
pattern
of
mass
and
fat
loss
and
gain
,
which
was
mirrored
by
patterns
of
Zugunruhe
.

Mean
mass
change
was
positively
correlated
(
r
0.977
)
with
mean
Zugunruhe
change
.

Birds
at
a
given
body
mass
(
e.g.17
g
)
responded
differently
depending
on
whether
their
mass
was
the
result
of
recent
gain
or
of
recent
loss
.

Birds
appear
not
to
use
absolute
body
mass
as
a
departure
cue
,
but
rely
on
internal
information
(
e.g.
plasma
metabolites
,
hormones
)
about
their
recent
experience
instead
.

DEMOGRAPHIC
CONSEQUENCES

DEVELOPMENT
TO
POPULATIONS
OF
SAGEBRUSH
OBLIGATE
SONGBIRDS
IN
THE
WYOMING
BASIN

I
studied
the
reproductive

apparent
survival
of
sagebrush
obligate
songbirds
(
Sage
Sparrow
,
Brewer
’s
Sparrow
,
and
Sage

)
both
within
and
outside
the
Jonah
Field
natural
gas
development
in
Wyoming
,
from
2002
through
2006
.

Nest
survival
rates
varied
among
locations
and
among
years
for
all
3
species
.

Variation
was
driven
both
by
summer
snow
events
which
increased
failure
rates
up
to
an
order
of
magnitude
over
background
levels
and
by
nest
predation
.

Nest
predation
was
highly
correlated
with
Common
Raven
abundance
and
constancy
across
study
areas
and
years
,
and
Common
Ravens
were
in
turn
associated
with
the
gas
development
where
nest
site
subsidies
were
widely
available
.

Apparent
survival
was
best
predicted
by
number
and
duration
of
snow
events
in
the
previous
breeding
season
which
could
be
due
to
reduced
survival
or
increased
emigration
as
a
result
of
nest
failures
.

Continued
monitoring
will
assess
potential
impacts
of
increased
well
density
as
expansion
and
infill
of
the
Jonah
Field
progresses

FORENSIC

CONSERVATION
Mortality
incidents
confronting

raise
a

of
questions
from
What
killed
these

?

to
Who
is
responsible
?

and
How
do
we
keep
it
from
happening
again
?

Forensic
investigations
of
avian
mortality
incorporate
analytical
chemistry
,
biomarkers
of
exposure
and

,
and
site
and
case
assessments
to
develop
hypotheses
for
the
cause

.

Experience
with
pesticides
,
metals
,
chlorinated
hydrocarbons
and
petroleum
compounds
has
led
to
methods
and
approaches
successfully
employed
with
avian
species
.

Background
residue
concentrations
and
biomarker
levels
from
unexposed
or
reference
individuals
are
compared
with
those
from
intoxicated
individuals
and
,
when
combined
with
site
and

reports
,
can
provide
the
smoking
gun
needed
for
diagnoses
.

Careful
consideration
of
the
strength
of

associations
determines
the
need
for

measures
necessary
to
avoid
further

Forensic

face
their
greatest
challenges
from

.

We
demonstrate
the
forensic

used
to
discover
the

BREEDING
SONGBIRD
RESPONSES
TO
RIPARIAN
RESTORATION

In
California
's
Central
Valley
over
95
%
of
the
riparian
habitat
has
been
lost
.

As
part
of
an
unprecedented
effort
to
restore
riparian
habitat
in
the
region
,
PRBO
Conservation
Science
has
monitored
bird
populations
at
restored
and
remnant
(
reference
)
riparian
sites
since
1993
in
five
regions
throughout
the
Central
Valley
.

We
use
direct
comparisons
,
attribute
analysis
,
trajectory
analysis
,
and
a
combination
of
these
techniques
to
evaluate
restoration
.

Following
restoration
,
avian
diversity
and
abundance
increased
in
all
regions
for
many
species
.

At
restored
sites
,
the
elapsed
time
since
restoration
affected
both
avian
abundance
and
nest
survival
rates
.

Some
birds
arrived
almost
immediately
after
restoration
,
whereas
others
did
not
recolonize
for
up
to
10
years
.

The
amount
of
riparian
habitat
and
agriculture
in
the
landscape
influenced
abundance
and
reproductive
success
in
some
regions
.

We
are
currently
developing
demographic
models
as
another
tool
for
the
evaluation
of
habitat
restoration
projects
.

We
will
discuss
the
challenges
and
opportunities
of
evaluating
restoration
in
general
and
the
strengths
and
weaknesses
of
our
approach
in
this
context

THE

Aquatic
mercury
contamination
is
a
well
-
documented
problem
for
fish
-
eating
birds
.

However
,
recent
research
has
found
that
terrestrial
insectivorous
birds
are
also
at
risk
of
exposure
.

At
our
study
site
,
the
mercury
-
contaminated
South
River
in
Virginia
,
songbirds
breeding
and
foraging
in
the
riparian
ecosystem
had
elevated
levels
.

This
indicates
that
mercury
can
leave
a
contaminated
aquatic
source
and
enter
the
riparian
food
web
,
impacting
a
wide
range
of
wildlife
.

Little
is
understood
about
the
spatial
extent
of
exposure
in
the
terrestrial
ecosystem
and
the
mechanism
by
which
aquatic
mercury
enters
the
terrestrial
food
chain
.

We
found
that
exposure
in
terrestrial
songbirds
decreased
with
their
territory
and
foraging
distance
from
the
contaminated
river
.

However
,
adults
with
territories
greater
than
300
meters
from
the
contaminated
river
still
had
elevated
levels
relative
to
birds
in
uncontaminated
areas
.

Investigation
of
prey
items
showed
that
predatory
terrestrial
spiders
accumulated
the
highest
loads
of
mercury
.

Further
research
will
uncover
how
these
terrestrial
spiders
are
accumulating
the
mercury
that
they
deliver
to
riparian
songbirds
.

We
experimentally
manipulated
parasite
load
by
lining
nests
with
a
nylon
cloth
to
exclude
parasites
from
feeding
on
nestlings
.

Lined
(
experimental
)
nests
had
significantly
fewer
parasites
than
unlined
(
control
)
nests
.

Lined
nests
produced
significantly
more
fledglings
than
unlined

.

We
also
present
data
on
the
relationship
between
parasite

BREEDING

COMMUNITIES
ON

-
AREA
GOLF
COURSES
AND
GREEN
SPACES

Though
some
studies
have
suggested
that
golf
courses
have
the
potential
to
serve
as
wildlife
habitat
,
only
a
few
have
examined
how
far
this
potential
can
be
extended
in
a
suburban
/
urban
system
.

Six
golf
courses
and
six
green
spaces
in
the
Montreal
area
were
surveyed
to
characterize
their
breeding
bird
communities
and
test
for
differences
in
these
assemblages
.

There
was
no
difference
in
the
mean
number
of
bird
species
(
golf
:
31
2.4
SE
;
green
:
33
4.5
SE
however
,
golf
courses
supported
fewer
total
species
(
golf
:
55
;
green
:
66
While
green
spaces
were
much
more
variable
in
their
landscape
characteristics
than
golf
courses
,
non
-
metric
multidimensional
scaling
showed
that
species
composition
differed
between
the
site
types
(
golf
course
vs
green
space
and
was
correlated
to
site
size
,
number
of
houses
,
deciduous
and
coniferous
tree
cover
,
vegetated
water
cover
,
and
grass
cover
.

This
suggests
that
urban
planners
should
strive
to
increase
the
amount
of
natural
cover
on
golf
courses
and
incorporate
large
undeveloped
buffers
around
sites
to
maintain
the
highest
species
richness
possible

NATIONAL
AND
STATE
WIND
POWER
GUIDELINES

The
Wind
Turbine
Guidelines
Advisory
Committee
is
developing
national
guidelines
for
siting
wind
power
projects
.

This
committee
will
provide
recommendations
to
the
U.S.
Fish
and
Wildlife
Service
on
developing
effective
measures
to
avoid
or
minimize
impacts
to
wildlife
and
their
habitats
related
to
wind
power
.

This
group
is
building
upon
the
Service
’s
earlier
guidelines
,
as
well
as
models
adopted
or
being
created
by
a
number
of
states
.

The
Committee
is
composed
of
representatives
of
the
wind
power
industry
,
state
agencies
,
tribes
,
environmental
groups
,
federal
agencies
,
and
other
non
-
governmental
organizations
.

The
Committee
expects
to
complete
its
work
in
2009
.

The
Washington
State
Department
of
Fish
and
Wildlife
developed
Wind
Power
Guidelines
in
2003
that
achieve
ways
to
reconcile
support
for
wind
power
projects
that
also
protect
wildlife
and
their
habitats
.

These
Wind
Power
Guidelines
include
provisions
to
protect
and
improve
our
native
habitats
.

TOXIC
EFFECTS
OF
CAROTENOID
PIGMENTS
:
THE
DARK
SIDE
OF
BRIGHT
COLORATION
Carotenoid
pigments
produce
yellow
,
orange
,
and
red
integumentary
coloration
that
has
been
shown
to
serve
as
a
reliable
signal
of
health
and
condition
.

In
many
birds
and
fish
,
individuals
gain
competitive
or
mating
advantages
by
ingesting
and
utilizing
large
quantities
of
carotenoid
pigments
and
at
least
some
carotenoid
pigments
serve
as
antioxidants
,
performing
important
functions
as
free
-
radical
scavengers
.

The
beneficial
effects
of
carotenoid
pigments
are
well
documented
,
but
rarely
have
researchers
considered
potential
detrimental
effects
of
hyperaccumulation
of
carotenoids
.

Here
we
maintained
American
Goldfinches
(
Carduelis
tristis
)
on
highor
low
-
carotenoid
diets
through
molt
and
tested
for
damage
to
the
liver
and
skeletal
muscle
.

High
intake
of
carotenoids
had
no
measureable
effect
on
liver
function
but
caused
an
increase
in
creatine
kinase
,
an
indicator
of
skeletal
muscle
breakdown
and
reduced
vertical
flight
performance
,
a
measure
of
skeletal
muscle
integrity
.

The
detrimental
effects
of
carotenoid
hyperaccumulation
were
approximately
equivalent
to
the
negative
effects
of
removing
all
carotenoids
from
the
diet
.

The
adverse
effects
observed
in
this
study
have
important
implications
for
theories
of
the
function
and
evolution
of
colorful
plumage
.

AMONG
TRANS
-
BERINGIAN
BIRDS
Beringia
,
the
area
of
land
that
connects
the
Eurasian
and
American
continents
,
has
been
a
center
of
diversification
and
speciation

The
cycle
of
glacial
and
interglacial
periods
during
the
Pleistocene
caused
a
matching
cycle
of
exposure
and
submergence
of
the
Beringian
land
mass
.

When
the
land
was
exposed
(
during
the
glacial
maxima
taxa
were
able
to
diversify
and
spread
across
Beringia
.

The
subsequent
submerging
of
the
land
mass
(
during
the
warmer
interglacials
)
then
split
the
taxa
into
two
.

Today
we
see
a
general
pattern
of
sister
taxa
(
whether
species
,
subspecies
or
populations
)
found
on
either
side
of
the
Bering
Strait
.

In
our
study
,
we
examined
broad
patterns
of
diversification
across
three
taxonomic
levels
within
three
avian
families
(
Anseriformes
,
Charadriiformes
and
Passeriformes

We
estimated
the
probably
number
of
divergence
events
that
occurred
among
our
9
taxon
pairs
using
the
program
msBayes
.

We
also
examined
whether
there
was
any
correlation
between
phenotypic
divergence
(
taxonomic
status
)
and
timing
of
divergence
in
Beringian
birds

Yellow
Warbler
is
a
California
Bird
Species
of
Special
Concern
due
primarily
to
the
severe
loss
of

Although

,
little

ASSESSING
POPULATION
TRENDS
AND
SAMPLING
METHODS
FOR
NIGHTJARS
IN
NORTH
AMERICA
Anecdotal
accounts
suggest
that
most
widespread
species
of
nightjars
(
Caprimulgidae
)
are
declining
in
the
United
States
and
Canada
.

A
limited
amount
of
trend
and
distributional
data
bear
this
out
,
but
there
is
need
for
a
more
robust
monitoring
program
to
better
track
population

in
this
poorly

group
of

.

In
this
paper
we
provide
an
overview
of
the
existing

indicating
population

and
speculate
somewhat
on
causes
for
those
declines
.

In

we

preliminary
results
from

BEHAVIORAL
SYNDROMES
IN
URBAN
AND
RURAL
POPULATIONS
OF
SONG
SPARROWS
Animals
colonizing
urban
habitats
are
often
noticeably
bold
in
the
presence
of
humans
.

Such
boldness
may
arise
due
to
habituation
,
as
urban
animals
learn
,
through
repeated
exposure
,
that
passing
humans
do
not
represent
a
threat
.

However
,
there
is
growing
research
suggesting
that
:
1
)
inherent
traits
,
as
opposed
to
learned
behavior
,
have
an
influence
on
which
species
invade
urban
habitats
,
and
2
)
individuals
exhibit
behavioral
syndromes
that
limit
behavioral
flexibility
,
and
not
all
individuals
may
be
able
to
demonstrate
an
appropriate
level
of
habituation
in
urban
environments
.

As
a
result
,
perhaps
only
birds
with
inherently
bold
personalities
could
successfully
settle
in
an
area
of
high
human
disturbance
,
and
further
,
we
might
also
expect
to
see
correlated
variation
in
other
behavioral
traits
such
as
territorial
aggression
.

In
this
study
,
we
examined
boldness
and
territorial
aggression
in
urban
and
rural
populations
of
song
sparrows
.

We
found
that
urban
birds
were
bolder
toward
humans
and
that
urban
birds
also
showed
higher
levels
of
territorial
aggression
.

An
overall
correlation
between
boldness
and
territorial
aggression
suggests
that
urban
habitats
may
select
for
bold
birds
.

EFFECTS

GRASSLANDS
IN

We
assessed
the
effects
of
haying
on
20
bird
species
in
several
hundred
Conservation
Reserve
Program
(
CRP
)
grasslands
in
nine
counties
of
four
states
in
the
northern
Great
Plains
between
1993
and
2007
.

We
compared
breeding
bird
densities
in
idled
and
hayed
fields
to
evaluate
changes
one
,
two
,
three
,
and
four
years
after
haying
.

Haying
of
CRP
grasslands
had
either
positive
or
negative
effects
on
grassland
birds
,
depending
on
the
species
,
the
county
,
and
the
number
of
years
after
the
initial
disturbance
.

Some
species
(
e.g
Savannah
Sparrow
,
Bobolink
)
responded
positively
in
all
four
years
after
haying
whereas
others
(
e.g
Baird
's
Sparrow
)
responded
negatively
.

Horned

,
Sedge
Wren
,
Grasshopper
Sparrow
,
Le
Conte
's

,
Dickcissel
,
and
Red
-
winged
Blackbird
showed
treatment
county
interactions
,
indicating
that
the
effects
of
haying
varied
geographically
.

The
responses
of
several
species
changed
direction
as
the
fields
recovered
from
haying
.

For
example
,
Clay
-
colored
Sparrow
densities
declined
the
first
year
after
haying
but
increased
in
the
subsequent
three
years
.

Results
from

USING

TO
UNRAVEL

PATTERNS
OF
HABITAT
SELECTION
AND
CARRY

OVER
EFFECTS
IN
MIGRATORY
GEESE

It
has
been
thought
for
some
time
that
carry
over
effects
may
explain
a
significant
amount
of
variation
in
life
history
parameters
,
however
it
is
only
in
the
past
10
years
that
we
have
begin
to
get
a
feel
for
just
how
important
they
might
be
.

Here
we
describe
a
migratory
system
(
Light
-
bellied
Brent
Geese
)
where
there
is
marked
seasonal
variation
in
habitat
use
and
despotic
exclusion
of
subordinate
individuals
from
high
quality
habitats
.

We
use
stable
isotope
analyses
to
show
that
there
is
a
paradox
,
whereby
dominant
individuals
fail
to
gain
access
to
the
highest
quality
habitats
(
marine
)
in
late
winter
,
a
time
when
most
birds
are
starting
to
put
on
body
mass
for
spring
migration
.

This
pattern
seems
likely
to
be
driven
by
the
poor
efficiencies
of
offspring
foraging
on
a
depleted
resource
,
forcing
their
parents
to
follow
them
on
to
terrestrial
habitats
where
resources
are
superabundant
but
of
much
lower
quality
.

We
have
evidence
that
these
effects
are
carried
over
onto
the
staging
and
ultimately
the
breeding
grounds
and
likely
have
a
pronounced
influence
on
population
dynamics
.

Golf
courses
ostensibly
offer
replacement
habitat
for
wildlife
,
especially
birds
,
that
are
displaced
during
urbanization
.

Research
,
however
,
is
mixed
as
to
whether
the
intensively
managed
golf
course
habitat
provides
the
resources
necessary
for
population
maintenance
.

This
five

study
in
the
Williamsburg
,
Virginia
area
shows
that
Eastern
Bluebirds
(
Sialia
sialis
)
exhibited
no
differences
in
clutch
or
brood
size
between
golf
course
and
reference
sites
(
p>0.05
Nestlings
,
however
,
were
in
poorer
condition
on
golf
courses
(
p<0.05
which
could
have
implications
for
the
overall
population
dynamics
.

Future
work
will
determine
if
this
lowered
condition
translates
into
poorer
fledgling
success
.

Decreased
fledgling
survival
could
cause
the
golf
course
habitat
to
function
as
an
ecological
trap
,
drawing
breeding
birds
in
with
its
open
green
space
while
not
allowing
them
to
reproduce
at
replacement
levels

Inference
of

ideally
requires
congruent

.

Although
mtDNA
is
the
molecule
of
choice
for
reconstructing

of
closely

,
any
mtDNA
tree
needs
corroboration
from
other
independent

such
as

.

Introns
are
challenging
due
to
their
slower
mutation
rate
and
sorting
rate
relative
to
mtDNA
,
and
are
more
affected
by
incomplete
lineage
sorting
and
retention
of

are

to

introns
(

sequenced
across
29
of
the
30
currently

produced
a

congruent
with
the

and
the

paper
we
describe
the
design
and
implementation
of
MuST
,
a
multilingual
information
retrieval
,
summarization
,
and
translation
system
.

MuST
integrates
machine

and
other
text

services
to
enable
users
to
perform
cross

language
information
retrieval
using
available
search
services
such
as
commercial
Internet
search
engines
.

To
handle
non

,
a

agent
can
be
deployed
,
specialized
local

services
can
be

,
and
shallow

can
be
added
to
provide
useful

.

A

study
of
augmenting
MuST
with
Indonesian

included
.

MuST
adopts
ubiquitous
web
browsers
as
its
primary
user
interface
,
and
provides
tightly

Which
is
more
important
:
the
journey
or
the
destination
?

Classical
Interactive
Information
Retrieval
(
IIR
)
based
on
work
-
task
scenarios
usually
puts
the
emphasis
on
the
destination
of
the
search
(
the
results
)
with
metrics
such
as
precision
and
recall
rather
than
the
search
journey
.

But
social
media
,
mobile
devices
and
other
pervasive
technologies
have
made
information
accessible
to
people
in
leisure
scenarios
and
open
up
casual
-
leisure
search
behaviours
motivated
by
hedonistic
need
such
as
having
fun
,
or
relaxing
instead
of
a
well
-
defined
information
need
.

During
search
sessions
users
might
find
irrelevant
information
but
they
may
keep
exploring
because
the
IR
system
satisfies
their
current
leisure
need
.

This
research
aims
to
understand
better
casual

leisure
search
behaviour
and
design
new
IR
systems
to
support
autotelic
search

The
aim
of
the

was
to
explore
various

The
paper
argues
that
information
science
can
best
serve
the
needs
of
interdisciplinary
scholarship
(
which
is
of
increasing
importance
)
by
developing
universal
classifications
of
the
phenomena
studied
by
scholars
and
the
theories
and
methods
applied
by
scholars
.

Present
systems
of
document
classification
are
grounded
in
disciplinary
terminology
and
thus
serve
interdisciplinary
scholarship
poorly
.

The
second
part
of
the
paper
outlines
the
importance
of
the
recommended
type
of
system
of
classification
,
the
limitations
of
present
systems
,
and
the
effects
of
these
limitations
on
interdisciplinary
scholarship
.

The
third
part
argues
that
such
a
system
of
classification
is
feasible
,
and
that
it
is
best
developed
through
a
combination
of
induction
and

the
mechanisms
for
measuring

similarity
through
assessing

through

It
uses

for

similarity
hypotheses

to

It
provides
the
means

The
automatic
organization
of
large
collections
of
documents
becomes
more
important
with
the
growth
of
the
amount
of
information
available
in
digital
form
.

This
study
contributes
to
this
issue
evaluating
the
use
of
Artificial
Neural
Networks
(
ANNs
)
to
automatically
categorize
documents
through
the
analysis
of
the
references
cited
in
these
documents
.

The
article
describes
the
method
developed
to
generate
clusters
of
documents
based
on
bibliometric
concepts
.

The
method
is
grounded
on
the
premise
that
the
presence
of
common
citations
is
indicative
of
relationships
among
documents
and
thus
publications
are
categorized
using
citations
as
the
main
input
information
.

ANNs
are
typically
used
to
solve
problems
related
to
approximation
,
prediction
,
classification
,
categorization
and
optimization
.

Many
of
the
experiments
reported
in
the
literature
describe
the
use
of
SOM
networks
,
Self
Organizing
Maps
,
in
the
organization
of
documents
for
information
retrieval
.

SOM
networks
are
used
in
this
work
in
order
to
categorize
documents
in
a
test
database
.

In
this
categorization
process
,
the
semantic
relationships
among
documents
are
defined
not
by
the
identification
of
terms
in
common
,
but
by
the
presence
of
common
cited
references
and
their
years
of
publication
.

After
validation
of
the
method
,
through
the
use
of
a
prototype
,
a
database
was
created
,
containing
the
references
cited
in
200
articles
published
in
the
IEEE
Transactions
on
Neural
Networks
Journal
,
between
years
of
2001
and
2010
.

The
publications
were
categorized
by
the
ANN
and
presented
in
groups
organized
by
their
common
citations
.

The
results
obtained
show
that
the
ANN
successfully
identified
clusters
of
authors
and
texts
,
through
their
cited
references
.

These
clusters
,
formed
through
automatic
classification
of
documents
,
evidence
the
existence
of
semantic
relationships
between
the
documents
.

They
can
be
useful
,
for
example
,
to
automatically
identify
groups
of
researchers
working
in
related
fields
or
for
identifying
research
trends
in
specific
domains
of
knowledge
.

Another
application
would
be
in
the
process
of
information
retrieval
,
where
they
could
assist
users
in
the
development
or
reformulation
of
their
queries
.

In
many
of
the
abstract
geometric
models
which
have
been
used
to
represent
concepts
and
their
relationships
,
regions
possessing
some
cohesive
property
such
as
convexity
or
linearity
have
played
a
significant
role
.

When
the
implication
or
containment
relationship
is
used
as
an
ordering
relationship
in
such
models
,
this
gives
rise
to
logical
operators
for
which
the
disjunction
of
two
concepts
is
often
larger
than
the
set
union
obtained
in
Boolean
models
.

This
paper
describes
some
of
the
characteristic
properties
of
such
broad
non
-
distributive
composition
operations
and
their
applications
to
learning
algorithms
and
classification
structures
.

As
an
example
we
describe
a
quad
-
tree
representation
which
we
have
used
to
provide
a
structure
for
indexing
objects
and
composition
of
regions
in
a
spatial
database
.

The
quad
-
tree
combines
logical
,
algebraic
and
geometric
properties
in
a
naturally
non
-
distributive
fashion
.

The
lattice
of
subspaces
of
a
vector
space
is
presented
as
a
special
example
,
which
draws
a
middle
-
way
between
‘
noninductive’
Boolean
logic
and
‘
overinductive’
tree
-
structures
.

This
gives
rise
to
composition
operations
that
are
already
used
as
models
in
physics
and
cognitive
science
.

Closure
conditions
in
geometric
models

The
hypothesis
that
concepts
can
be
represented
by
points
and
more
general
regions
in
spatial
models
has
been
used
by
psychologists
and
cognitive
scientists
to
simulate
human
language
learning
(
Landauer

to

The
last
question
how
are
empirical
observations
gathered
into

described
by
the

word
or
represented
by
the

concept
is
of
traditional
importance
in
philosophy
and
many
related
disciplines
.

The
extrapolation
from
observed
data
to
classifying
previously
unexperienced
situations
is
implemented
in
a
variety
of
theoretical
models
and
practical
applications
,
using
smoothing
and
clustering
,
by
exploiting
a
natural
general

ordering
on
the

of
observations

and
by
using

measures

gauge
the
influence
exerted
by
a
cluster
of
observations
upon
its
conceptual
hinterland
(
Gärdenfors

.

Mathematically
,
such
extrapolation
techniques
are
related
to
closure
conditions
,
a
set
being
closed
if
it
has
no
tendency
to
include
new
members
.

A
traditional
example
of
closure
is
in
the
field
of
topology
,
which
describes
a
set
as
being
closed
if
it
contains
the
limit
point
of
every
possible
sequence
of
elements
.

A
more
easily
-
grasped
example
is
given
by
the
property
of
convexity
.

A
set
S
is
said
to
be
convex
if
for
any
two
pointsA
andB
in
S
,
the
straight
lineAB
lies
entirely

The
number
of
scientific
publications
is
constantly
increasing
,
and
the
results
published
on
Empirical
Software
Engineering
are
growing
even
faster
.

Some
software
engineering
publishers
have
began
to
collaborate
with
research
groups
to
make
available
repositories
of
software
engineering
empirical
data
.

However
,
these
initiatives
are
limited
due
to
issues
related
to
the
available
search
tools
.

As
a
result
,
many
researchers
in
the
area
have
adopted
a
semi
-
automated
approach
for
performing
searches
for
systematic
reviews
as
a
mean
to
extract
empirical
evidence
from
published
material
.

This
makes
this
activity
labor
intensive
and
error
prone
.

In
this
paper
,
we
argue
that
the
use
of
techniques
from
information
retrieval
,
as
well
as
text
mining
,
can
support
systematic

improve
the

With
the
fast
booming
of
online
music
repositories
,
there
is
a
need
for
content
-
based
automatic
indexing
which
will
help
users
to
find
their
favorite
music
objects
in
real
time
.

Recently
,
numerous
successful
approaches
on
musical
data
feature
extraction
and
selection
have
been
proposed
for
instrument
recognition
in
monophonic
sounds
.

Unfortunately
,
none
of
these
methods
can
be
successfully
applied
to
polyphonic
sounds
.

Identification
of
music
instruments
in
polyphonic
sounds
is
still
difficult
and
challenging
,
especially
when
harmonic
partials
are
overlapping
with
each
other
.

This
has
stimulated
the
research
on
music
sound
separation
and
new
features
development
for
content
-
based
automatic
music
information
retrieval
.

Our
goal
is
to
build
a
cooperative
query
answering
system
(
QAS
for
a
musical
database
,
retrieving
from
it
all
objects
satisfying
queries
like
”

all
musical
pieces
in
pentatonic
scale
with
a
viola
and
piano
where
viola
is
playing
for
minimum
20
seconds
and
piano
for
minimum
10
seconds

We
use
the
database
of
musical
sounds
,
containing
almost
4000
sounds
taken
from
the
MUMs
(
McGill
University
Master
Samples
as
a
vehicle
to
construct
several
classifiers
for
automatic
instrument
recognition
.

Classifiers
showing
the
best
performance
are
adopted
for
automatic
indexing
of
musical
pieces
by
instruments
.

Our
musical
database
has
an
FS
-
tree
(
Frame
Segment
Tree
)
structure
representation
.

The
cooperativeness
of
QAS
is
driven
by
several
hierarchical
structures
used
for
classifying
musical
instruments

Multimedia
Information
Retrieval
is
very
useful
for
any
application
in
our
daily
work
.

Most
of
the
applications
consist
of
Multimedia
data
that
are
images
,
text
,
audio
and
video
.

Multimedia
information
retrieval
system
is
used
to
search
an
image
.

There
are
same
meanings
for
different
data
which
is
also
known
as
semantic
gap
.

This
problem
is
solved
by
fusion
of
text
based
image
retrieval
and
content
based
image
retrieval
.

Weighted
Mean
,
OWA
and
WOWA
are
aggregation
operators
used
in
this
system
for
the
fusion
of
text
and
image
numeric
values
.

The
Scale
invariant
feature
transforms
and
speeded

are
two
algorithms
for
feature
extraction
.

To
increase
the
speed
of

,
the
speeded

robust
feature
algorithm
is
used
.

Bag

We

Design
and
implementation
of
industrial
systems
requires
a
greater
understanding
and
knowledge
about
the
role
of
information
in
systems
operation
.

Today
,
a
growing
complexity
of
information
flow
is
a
characteristic
of
the
majority
of
industries
.

Systems
also
operate
in
changing
environments
surrounded
by
numerous
uncertainties
and
disturbances
.

Difficulties
arise
from
unexpected
tasks
and
events
and
from
a
multitude
of
possible
failures
and
other
interactions
during
the
attempt
to
control
various
activities
in
dynamic
environments
.

Therefore
,
information
management
is
one
of
the
most
important
aspects
to
be
considered
in
intelligent
systems
development
which
are
expected
to
solve
unforeseen
problems
even
on
the
basis
of
incomplete
and
imprecise
information
.

This
is
a
new
paradigm
which
creates
an
enormous
challenge
for
economics
,
management
and
engineering
in
the
new
millennium
.

To
meet
this
challenge
,
a
number
of
conference
series
is
run
each
year
,
and
they
try
to
define
and
solve
the
problems
emerging
in
our
information

.

One
of
these

is
the

Conference
(

This
Special

contains
carefully

that
expand
significantly
on
those
topics
of

,
held
in

Australia
,
in

2004
;
these
topics
may
be
of
interest
to
information

and
information
systems
'
communities
.

I
chaired
the
Track

Special
Sessions
on
Information

during
this
conference
.

Generally
,
the
papers
presented
in
my
sessions
,
and
at
the
conference
as
a
whole
,
dealt
with
various
issues
related
to
managing
real
-
life
systems
functioning
in
information
reach
environments
.

The
common
theme
that
was
integrating
a
number
of
presentations
at
APIEMS'04
was
the
drive
to
develop
and
implement
advanced
information

tools
and
approaches
that
can
be
useful
in
modeling

and
improving

in
variety
of

Answering
science
questions
posed
in
natural
language
is
an
important
AI
challenge
.

Answering
such
questions
often
requires
non
-
trivial
inference
and
knowledge
that
goes
beyond
factoid
retrieval
.

Yet
,
most
systems
for
this
task
are
based
on
relatively
shallow
Information
Retrieval
(
IR
)
and
statistical
correlation
techniques
operating
on
large
unstructured
corpora
.

We
propose
a
structured
inference
system
for
this
task
,
formulated
as
an
Integer
Linear
Program
(
ILP
that
answers
natural
language
questions
using
a
semi
-
structured
knowledge
base
derived
from
text
,
including
questions
requiring
multi
-
step
inference
and
a
combination
of
multiple
facts
.

On
a
dataset
of
real
,
unseen
science
questions
,
our
system
significantly
outperforms
14
the
best
previous
attempt
at
structured
reasoning
for
this
task
,
which
used
Markov
Logic
Networks
(
MLNs
It
also
improves
upon
a
previous
ILP
formulation
by
17.7
When
combined
with
unstructured
inference
methods
,
the
ILP
system
significantly
boosts
overall
performance

Finally
,
we
show
our
approach
is
substantially
more
robust
to
a
simple

compared
to
statistical

In
this
paper
,
we
present
a
method
that
detects
patterns
of
user
activity
on
a
web
video
,
in
order
to
extract
video
scenes
.

Previous
research
in
video
retrieval
has
focused
on
content
-
based
techniques
,
such
as
pattern
recognition
algorithms
that
attempt
to
understand
the
low
-
level
features
of
a
video
.

There
have
also
been
user
-
based
approaches
,
but
they
have
assumed
an
extra
effort
by
the
users
,
such
as
comments
,
tags
,
and
annotations
.

We
are
proposing
a
stochastic
pulse
modeling
method
,
which
makes
sense
of
a
web
video
by
analyzing
implicit
user
interactions
,
such
as
pause
and
thirty
seconds
rewind
.

In
particular
,
we
have
modeled
the
user
information
seeking
behavior
as
a
continuous
signal
and
the
semantic
regions
as
a
discrete
pulse
of
fixed
width
.

Then
,
we
have
devised
a
controlled
user
experiment
with
two
types
of
information
-
rich
videos
(
lecture
,
documentary
)
and
calculated
the
correlation
coefficient
between
dynamically
detected
pulses
at
the
local
maximums
of
the
user
activity
signal
and
the
pulse
of
reference
.

We
have
found
that
if
the
users
are
actively
seeking
for
information
in
a
video
,
then
their
activity
significantly
matches
the
semantics
of
the
video
.

This
research
complements
previous
work
on
content
-
based
information
retrieval
and
provides
an
additional
user
-
based
dimension
for
modeling
the
semantics
of
a
social
web
video

In

to
evaluate
and

the
effectiveness
of

in

from

necessary
framework
to
incorporate
relevant
cognitive
psychology
theories
and
user

design
principles
in

foundation
,
complied
with
relevant

,
and
included

Our
results
suggest
that
interface
design
may
have
a
significant
effect
on
system

user
concept
communication
,
regardless
of
users’
familiarity
with
the

and
that
a

may
be
more

Furthermore
,
we
also
examined
the
cognitive

Key
frames
are
playing
a
very
important
role
for
many
video
applications
,
such
as
on
-
line
movie
preview
and
video
information
retrieval
.

Although
a
number
of
key
frame
selection
methods
have
been
proposed
in
the
past
,
existing
technologies
mainly
focus
on
how
to
precisely
summarize
the
video
content
,
but
seldom
take
the
user
preferences
into
consideration
.

However
,
in
real
scenarios
,
people
may
cast
diverse
interests
on
the
contents
even
for
the
same
video
,
and
thus
they
may
be
attracted
by
quite
different
key
frames
,
which
makes
the
selection
of
key
frames
an
inherently
personalized
process
.

In
this
paper
,
we
propose
and
investigate
the
problem
of
personalized
key
frame
recommendation
to
bridge
the
above
gap
.

To
do
so
,
we
make
use
of
video
images
and
user
time
-
synchronized
comments
to
design
a
novel
key
frame
recommender
that
can
simultaneously
model
visual
and
textual
features
in
a
unified
framework
.

By
user
personalization
based
on
her
/
his
previously
reviewed
frames
and
posted
comments
,
we
are
able
to
encode
different
user
interests
in
a
unified
multi
-
modal
space
,
and
can
thus
select
key
frames
in
a
personalized
manner
,
which
,
to
the
best
of
our
knowledge
,
is
the
first
time
in
the
research
field
of
video
content
analysis
.

Experimental
results
show
that
our
method
performs
better
than
its

This
work
addresses
the
issue
of
accessing
the
content
of
digital
texts
,
in
so
as
it
is
anchored
in
time
.

The
aim
of
this
work
is
twofold
:
it
consists
in
conciliating
a
linguistic
approach
and
an
applied
approach
,
to
participate
in
the
development
of
new
tools
for
text
mining
and
information
retrieval
.

It
is
thus
both
about
implementing
interaction
systems
and
modeling
the
semantics
of
one
the
most
salient
textual
units
that
contributes
to
anchor
in
time
the
situations
described
in
texts
:
temporal
locating
adverbials
.

The
linguistic
analysis
aims
to
show

Following
the
tradition
of
these
acceptance
talks
,
I
will
begiving
my
thoughts
on
where
our
field
is
going
.

Any
discussion
ofthe
future
of
information
retrieval
(
IR
)
research
,
however
,
needsto
be
placed
in
the
context
of
its
history
and
relationship
toother
fields
.

Although
IR
has
had
a
very
strong
relationship
withlibrary
and
information
science
,
its
relationship
to
computerscience
(
CS
)
and
its
relative
standing
as
a
sub
-
discipline
of
CShas
been
more
dynamic
.

IR
is
quite
an
old
field
,
and
when
a
numberof
CS
departments
were
forming
in
the
60s
,
it
was
not
uncommon
fora
faculty
member
to
be
pursuing
research
related
to
IR
.

Early
ACMcurriculum
recommendations
for
CS
contained
courses
on
informationretrieval
,
and
encyclopedias
described
IR
and
database
systems
asdifferent
aspects
of
the
same
field
.

By
the
70s
,
there
were
only
a
few
IR
researchers
in
CSdepartments
in
the
U.S
database
systems
was
a
separate
(
andthriving
)
field
,
and
many
felt
that
IR
had
stagnated
and
waslargely
irrelevant
.

The
truth
,
in
fact
,
was
far
from
that
.

The
IRresearch
community
was
a
small
,
but
dedicated
,
group
of
researchersin
the
U.S.
and
Europe
who
were
motivated
by
a
desire
to
understandthe
process
of
information
retrieval
and
to
build
systems

thatwould
help
people
find
the
right
information
in
text
databases
.

This
was
(
and
is
)
a
hard
goal
and
led
to
different
evaluationmetrics
and
methodologies
than
the
database
community
.

Progress
inthe
field
was
hampered
by
a
lack
of
large
-
scale
testbeds
and
testswere
limited
to
databases
containing
at
most
a
few
hundred
documentabstracts
.

In
the
80s
AI
boom
,
IR
was
still
not
a
mainstream
area
,
despiteits
focus
on
a
human
task
involving
natural
language
.

IR
focused
ona
statistical
approach
to
language
rather
than
the
much
morepopular
knowledge
-
based
approach
.

The
fact
that
IR
conferences
mixpapers
on
effectiveness
as
measured
by
human
judgments
with
papersmeasuring
performance
of
file
organizations
for
large
-
scale
systemshas
meant
that
IR
has
always
been
difficult
to
classify
into
simplecategories
such
as
"
systems
"
or
"
AI
"
that
are
often
used
in
CSdepartments
.

Since
the
early
90s
,
just
about
everything
has
changed
.

Large
,
full
-
text
databases
were
finally
made
available
for
experimentationthrough
DARPA
funding
and
TREC
.

This
has
had
an
enormous
positiveimpact
on
the
quantity
and
quality
of
IR
research
.

The
advent
ofthe
Web
search
engine
has
validated
the
longstanding
claims
made
byIR
researchers
that
simple
queries
and
ranking
were
the
righttechniques
for
information
access
in
a
largely
unstructuredinformation
world
.

What
has
not
changed
is
that
there
are
stillrelatively
few
IR
researchers
in
CS
departments
.

There
are
,
however
,
many
more
people
in
CS
departments
doing
IR
-
relatedresearch
,
which
is
just
about
the
same
thing
.

Conferences
indatabases
,
machine
learning
,
computational
linguistics
,
and
datamining
publish
a
number
of
IR
papers
done
by
people
who
would
notprimarily
consider
themselves
as
IR
researchers
.

Given
that
there
is
an
increasing
diffusion
of
IR
ideas
into
theCS
community
,
it
is
worth
stating
what
IR
,
as
a
field
of
CS
,
hasaccomplished
ul><li
>

Search
engines
have
become
the
infrastructure
for
much
ofinformation
access
in
our
society
.

IR
has
provided
the
basicresearch
on
the
algorithms
and
data
structures
for
these
engines
,
and
continues
to
develop
new
capabilities
such
as
cross

,
distributed

,
question

and
topic

IR
championed
the
statistical
approach
to
language
long
beforeit
was
accepted
by
other
researchers
working
on
languagetechnologies
.

Statistical
NLP
is
now
mainstream
and
results
fromthat
field
are
being
used
to
improve
IR
systems
(
in
questionanswering
,
for
example

IR
focused
on
evaluation
as
a
research
area
,
and
developed
anevaluation
methodology
based
on
large
,
standardized
testbeds
andcomparison
with
human
judgments
that
has
been
adopted
byresearchers
in
a
number
of
other
language
technology
areas
li><li

IR
,
because
of
its
focus
on
measuring
success
based
on
humanjudgments
,
has
always
acknowledged
the
importance
of
the
user
andinteraction
as
a
part
of
information
access
.

This
led
to
a
numberof
contributions
to
the
design
of
query
and
search
interfaces
andlearning
techniques
based
on
user
feedback

ul><br><br

Although
these
achievements
are
important
,
the
long
-
term
goalsof
the
IR
field
have
not
yet
been
met
.

What
are
those
goals
?

Onepossibility
that
is
often
mentioned
is
the
MEMEX
of
Vannevar

Another
,
more
recent
,
statement
of
long

in

of

These
goals
are
,
in
fact
,
very
similar
to
long
-
term
challengescoming
out
of
other
CS
fields
.

For
example
,
Jim
Gray
,
a
TuringAward
winner
from
the
database
area
,
mentioned
in
his
address
apersonal
and
world
MEMEX
as
long
-

goals
for
his
field
and
CS
ingeneral
[
3
IR
's
long
-
term
goals
are
clearly
important
long
-
termgoals
for
the
whole
of
CS
,
and
achieving
those
goals
will
involveeveryone
interested
in
the
general
area
of
information
managementand
retrieval
.

Rather
than
talking
about
what
IR
can
do
inisolation
to
progress
towards
its
goals
,
I
would
prefer
to
talkabout
what
IR
can
do
in
collaboration
with
other
areas
.

There
are
many
examples
of
potential
collaborative
researchareas
.

Collaborations
with
researchers
from
the
NLP
and
informationextraction
communities
have
been
developing
for
some
time
in
orderto
study
topics
such
as
advanced
question
answering
.

On
the
otherhand
,
not
enough
has
been
done
to
work
with
the
database
communityto
develop
probabilistic
retrieval
models
for
unstructured
,
semi
-
structured
,
and
structured
data
.

There
have
been
a
number
ofattempts
to
combine
IR
and
database
functionality
,
none
of
whichhas
been
particularly
successful
.

Most
recently
,
some
groups
havebeen
working
on
combining
IR
search
with
XML
documents
,
but
what
isneeded
is
a
comprehensive
examination
of
the
issues
and
problems
byteams
from
both
areas
working
together
,
and
the
creation
of
newtestbeds
that
can
be
used
to
evaluate
proposed
models
.

The
time
isright
for
such
collaborations
.

Another
example
of
where
database
,
IR
,
and
networking
people
canwork
together
is
in
the
development
of
distributed
,
heterogeneousinformation
systems
.

This
requires
significant
new
research
inareas
like
peer
-
to
-
peer
architectures
,
semantic
heterogeneity
,
automatic
metadata
generation
,
and
retrieval
models
.

If
the
information
systems
described
above
are
extended
toinclude
new
data
types
such
as
video
,
images
,
sound
,
and
the
wholerange
of
scientific
data
(
such
as
from
the
biosciences
,
geoscience
,
and
astronomy
then
a
broad
range
of
new
challenges
are
added
thatneed
to
be
tackled
in
collaboration
with
people
who
know
aboutthese
types
of
data
.

There
should
also
be
more
cooperation
between
the
data
mining
,
IR
,
and
summarization
communities
to
tackle
the
core
problem
ofdefining
what
is
new
and
interesting
in
streams
of
data
.

These
and
other
similar
collaborations
will
the
basis
for
thefuture
development
of
the
IR
field
.

We
will
continue
to
work
onresearch
problems
that
specifically
interest
us
,
but
this
researchwill
increasingly
be
in
the
context
of
larger
efforts
.

IR
conceptsand
IR
research
will
be
an
important
part
of
the
evolving
mix
of
CSexpertise
that
will
be
used
to
solve
the
"
grand
"
challenges

Clothes
products
contain
many
characteristics
which
are
difficult
to
describe
in
keywords
,
such
as
texture
,
shape
,
or
the
relationship
between
object
and
space
.

Based
on
this
issue
,
we
develop
an
image
-
based
visual
clothing
retrieval
system
,
which
extracts
and
uses
the
features
of
clothing
images
to
find
objects
that
are
difficult
to
describe
by
text
,
or
without
text
annotations
.

We
integrate
techniques
from
image
processing
and
information
retrieval
,
and
develop
our

Tsinghua
University
Information
Retrieval
Group
(
THUIR
)
has
participated
into
the
first
Relevance
Feedback
Track
of
TREC2008
.

The
TMiner
search
engine
has
been
used
as
our
text
retrieval
system
,
because
the
processing
capability
and
flexibility
of
this
system
on
large
text
data
has
been
testified
during
many
years’
Web
Track
and
Terabyte
Track
.

In
the
track
,
we
studied
two
approaches
:
1
)
query
expansion
,
2
)
search
result
re
-
ranking
based
on
document
relevance
model
.

Query
Expansion
:

Terms
in
the
annotated
documents
(
feedback
)
are
used
to
expand
the
original
query
;
the
new
born
queries
are
sent
to
the
search
engine
for
further
information
retrieval
;
users
get
the
documents
retrieved
by
the
expanded
queries
.

Search
Result
Re
-
ranking
:
The
relevance
between
the
annotated
documents
and
other
documents
are
used
to
influence
the
search
results
;
users
finally
get
the
re
-
ranked
document
list
.

In
detail
,
we
have
experimented
two
different
methods
on
which
search
result
re

based
:
a

is
structured
as
follows
.

After
the
introduction
of
Query

approach
in
Section

is
discussed
in

.

The

results
of
the
