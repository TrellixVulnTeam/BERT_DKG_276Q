Social O

a O

The O

on O

a O

the O

on O
the O

the O

This O

Though O

the O
leading O
RF O
approach O
in O
CLIR O
and O
it O
can O
take O
place O
before O

and O
after O
translating O
the O

, O
it O
should O
not O
be O
the O
only O
possible O
RF O
method O

In O
our O
demonstration O
, O
besides O
an O

of O

QE O
, O
we O
also O
implement O
a O

out O

However O
, O
it O

that O

a O
major O

its O

two O

The O

The O
design O

a O
central O
aspect O

the O

Music O
Information O
Retrieval O

However O
, O

the O

the O

feature O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
provision O

a O

be O
critical O

the O

the O

This O
paper O

an O

statistical O

that O
have O
yielded O
fruitful O

fields O

to O
the O
problem O
of O
establishing O
relationships O

A O

these O
techniques O
constitutes O
a O
new O
method O
of O
comparing O

The O
method O

and O
employs O

which O
