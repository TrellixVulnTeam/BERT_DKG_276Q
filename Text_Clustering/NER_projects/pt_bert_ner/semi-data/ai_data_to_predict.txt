When O

A O
common O
problem O
of O
expert O
combination O
approaches O
in O
Information O
Retrieval O
( O
IR O

is O
the O
selection O
of O
both O
, O
the O
experts O
to O
be O
combined O
and O
the O
combination O
function O
. O

In O
most O
studies O
the O
experts O
are O
selected O
from O
a O
rather O
small O
set O
of O
candidates O
using O
some O
heuristics O

Thus O
, O
only O
a O
reduced O
number O
of O

combinations O
is O
considered O
and O
other O
possibly O
better O
solutions O
are O
left O
out O

In O
this O
paper O
we O
propose O
the O
use O
of O
genetic O
algorithms O
to O
find O
a O
suboptimal O
combination O
of O
experts O
for O
a O

Our O
system O
automatically O
determines O
both O
, O
the O
experts O
to O
be O
combined O
and O
the O
parameters O
of O
the O
combination O
function O
. O

We O
test O
and O
evaluate O
the O
approach O
on O
four O
classical O
text O
collections O
. O

The O
results O
show O
that O
the O
learnt O
combination O
strategies O
perform O
better O
than O
any O
of O
the O
individual O
methods O

that O

Obviously O
, O
such O

, O
it O

the O

enhance O

Both O
may O
be O
viewed O
as O

Our O
text O

is O
based O
on O
the O

extended O
with O
the O

Components O
are O
regarded O

an O

Visualization O

an O
essential O
step O
in O
the O
Information O

Indeed O
Information O
User O
Interfaces O
are O
used O
as O
a O
link O
between O

Information O
Retrieval O
Systems O
, O
and O
so O
they O
enable O

give O

Due O
to O
the O
importance O
that O
takes O
visualization O
of O

, O
many O
interfaces O
( O
which O
can O
be O

, O
in O

in O

) O
have O
been O
proposed O
in O
the O

However O
, O
although O
some O
evaluations O

these O

were O
proposed O
, O
they O
are O
too O
rare O
and O
not O
really O
interpretable O
( O

) O
due O
to O
the O
big O
heterogeneity O
of O
systems O
and O
due O
to O
the O
absence O
of O
an O

framework O
. O

So O
, O
in O
this O
paper O
, O
we O
propose O
to O
define O
a O
set O
of O

which O
take O

In O
one O

or O
another O
language O
translation O
is O
a O
necessary O
part O
of O
cross O

lingual O
information O

systems O
. O

Often O

this O

accomplished O
using O
machine O
translation O
systems O

However O
, O
machine O
translation O
systems O
offer O
low O
quality O
for O
their O
high O
costs O

This O
paper O
proposes O
a O
machine O
translation O
method O
that O
is O
low O
cost O
while O
improving O
translation O
quality O
. O

This O
is O
done O
by O
utilizing O
multiple O
web O
based O
translation O
services O
to O
negate O
the O
high O
cost O
of O
translation O
. O

A O
best O
translation O
is O
chosen O
from O
the O
candidates O
using O
either O
consensus O
translation O
selection O
or O
statistical O
analysis O
. O

Which O
to O
use O
is O
determined O
by O
a O
heuristic O
rule O
that O
takes O
into O
account O
that O
most O
web O
based O
translation O
services O
are O
of O
similar O
quality O
and O
that O
machine O
translation O
still O
produces O
relatively O
poor O
results O
. O

By O
choosing O
the O
best O
translation O
the O
method O
is O
able O
to O
increase O
translation O
quality O
over O
the O
base O

which O

One O
of O
the O
difficulties O
faced O
in O
implementing O
information O
management O
and O
retrieval O
systems O
is O
that O
each O
case O
seems O
to O
present O
its O
own O
special O
complexities O
. O

As O
a O
result O
information O
retrieval O
systems O
typically O
fall O
behind O
their O
programming O
schedule O
and O
have O
many O
bugs O

In O

a O
set O
of O
basic O
operations O
on O

are O
defined O
. O

These O
operations O
are O
intended O
to O
fulfill O
the O
same O
role O
for O
information O

programmers O
that O
functions O
such O
as O

) O
fill O
for O
mathematical O
applications O
programmers O
they O
should O
make O
the O
job O
very O
much O
easier O

as O
a O

Many O

Since O

that O
it O

We O

a O

The O

an O
information O

system O
which O
might O
be O
one O
of O
the O
most O
efficient O
systems O
for O
very O
large O
document O

. O

AIR O
can O
store O
the O

the O

These O

which O
are O
based O
on O
the O

are O
fairly O

that O

The O

The O

attempts O
that O

The O

a O

We O
use O
the O

Two O

the O
effectiveness O
of O
information O

systems O
are O
, O
respectively O
, O
the O
recall O
and O
the O

Since O
the O
determination O
of O
these O
measures O
is O
dependent O
on O
a O
distinction O
between O
documents O
which O
are O
relevant O
on O
the O
one O
hand O

and O
documents O
which O
are O
not O
relevant O
on O
the O

to O
a O

it O
has O
sometimes O
been O
claimed O
that O
an O
accurate O
, O
generally O
valid O
evaluation O
can O
not O
be O
based O
on O
recall O

precision O
. O

A O
study O
was O
made O
to O
determine O
the O

Using O

it O
is O
found O
that O
large O

differences O
in O
the O

do O
not O
produce O
significant O

It O
thus O
appears O
that O

Our O
motivation O
as O
guest O
editors O
started O
from O
the O
observation O
that O
main O
discourses O
in O
both O
fields O
are O
different O
, O
that O
communities O
are O
only O
partly O
overlapping O
and O
from O
the O
belief O
that O
a O
knowledge O
transfer O
would O
be O
profitable O
for O
both O
sides O

were O

the O

the O

In O
Information O
Retrieval O
( O

the O

gap O

the O
difference O
between O
what O

There O
are O
several O
reasons O

the O
existence O

those O
gaps O
such O
as O
homonymy O

it O

The O
result O

This O

The O

this O

Language O
modeling O
approaches O
to O
information O

are O
attractive O
and O

because O
they O
connect O
the O
problem O

which O

areas O

The O
basic O
idea O
of O
these O
approaches O
is O
to O
estimate O
a O
language O
model O
for O
each O
document O
, O
and O
then O
rank O
documents O
by O
the O
likelihood O
of O
the O
query O
according O
to O
the O
estimated O
language O
model O
. O

A O
core O
problem O
in O
language O
model O
estimation O
is O
smoothing O
, O
which O
adjusts O
the O
maximum O
likelihood O
estimator O

as O
to O
correct O
the O

This O

go O

of O

Simple O

The O
model O

in O
the O
paper O
is O
based O
on O
Markov O
random O
fields O
and O
allows O
almost O
arbitrary O
features O

This O
provides O
a O
powerful O
mechanism O
for O
modeling O
many O
of O
the O
implicit O
constraints O
a O

in O

when O

a O

Simple O
instantiations O
of O
the O
model O

the O

shown O

of O
a O
monolingual O

We O
took O

Our O
objective O
was O
twofold O

On O
the O
one O

we O
intended O
to O
increase O
the O

by O
a O
heuristic O

combination O
of O
the O

For O
this O
, O
we O
provide O
an O

on O

On O

combining O
an O

the O

without O

ranked O
1st O

in O
the O

However O
, O
we O

In O
probabilistic O
approaches O
to O
information O
retrieval O
, O
the O
occurrence O
of O
a O
query O

in O
a O
document O
contributes O
to O
the O
probability O
that O
the O

It O
is O
typically O
assumed O
that O
the O
weight O
assigned O

a O
query O

should O
be O
based O
on O
the O
expected O

that O

In O
this O
paper O
we O
show O
that O
the O

observable O
document O

such O
as O

are O
expected O
to O
< O

By O
means O
of O
stochastic O

we O
show O
that O
increased O

performance O

We O
further O
show O
that O
by O
decreasing O
term O
weights O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
variance O
, O
this O
degradation O
can O
be O
reduced O

Hence O
, O
probabilistic O

must O
take O
into O

not O
only O
the O

We O

We O

The O

In O
this O

we O
present O
a O

GALOIS O

which O
is O
able O
to O
determine O
the O
concept O

a O

GALOIS O

the O

each O

GALOIS O

the O

We O

that O
GALOIS O
can O
be O
successfully O

and O
the O
extraction O

. O

This O
task O
is O
hard O
because O
most O
of O
the O
information O
on O
the O
Web O
today O
is O
in O
the O
form O
of O
HTML O
documents O
, O
which O
are O
designed O
for O

purposes O

not O

This O
task O
becomes O
even O
harder O
in O
a O
multilingual O
context O
, O
where O
web O
pages O
in O
different O

need O
to O

the O

This O

One O
of O
the O

in O

retrieval O
is O
the O
retrieval O
of O

for O
a O

a O

While O
retrieval O

A O

It O
also O
uses O
heuristic O
methods O
for O
the O
categorization O
of O

in O

Our O

the O

this O

on O
the O

To O

how O

Finally O
, O
we O
used O

The O

Conjunctive O
Boolean O

are O
a O
fundamental O
operation O
in O

These O

can O
be O
reduced O
to O
the O
problem O
of O
intersecting O

sets O
of O
integers O

where O
each O
set O
represents O
the O

one O

the O

the O

In O

Semantic O
query O
optimisation O
uses O
semantic O
knowledge O
to O
transform O
a O
query O
into O
another O
form O
that O
can O
be O
executed O
in O
a O
more O
efficient O
manner O
but O
still O
yields O
the O
same O
result O
as O
the O
original O
query O

Commonly O
this O
semantic O
knowledge O
is O
in O
the O

are O
generated O
either O
during O
the O

Over O

the O

, O

very O
large O
and O
the O
number O
of O
semantically O
equivalent O
queries O
which O
may O

derived O
rises O
exponentially O

The O
problem O
is O
to O
identify O
a O
near O
optimal O
alternative O
query O
in O
a O
time O
which O
is O
minimal O
and O
also O
short O
relative O
to O
the O
overall O
query O
execution O
time O

In O
this O
paper O
we O
propose O
a O
method O
of O
measuring O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
each O
rule O
and O
present O
a O
fast O
algorithm O
which O
selects O
the O
most O

effective O
transformations O
to O

a O

Although O

we O

In O

will O
start O

One O
critical O
aspect O
of O

is O
indexing O

that O

the O

Until O

, O
this O
task O
was O
accomplished O
by O
creating O
a O
bibliographic O

This O
approach O
allows O
a O
reduction O
in O
time O

space O
bounds O
, O
although O
it O
does O
not O
facilitate O
the O
user O
from O
finding O
relevant O
information O
. O

In O
effect O
, O
it O
is O
the O
combination O
of O
the O
words O
and O
their O
semantic O
implications O
that O
contain O
the O
value O
of O
these O
concepts O

which O
leads O
us O
to O
more O
sophisticated O
index O

such O

This O
information O
is O
inherent O
in O
the O

So O

a O
possible O
mechanism O

extract O

Previous O

In O
this O
paper O
, O
we O
try O
to O
exploit O
the O
semantic O
richness O
of O
Arabic O

for O
Information O
Retrieval O

The O
semantics O
of O
Arabic O
words O
may O
be O
extracted O
from O
dictionaries O
or O
corpora O
, O
which O
are O
analyzed O
and O
minded O
using O
Natural O
Language O
Processing O
( O
NLP O
) O
and O
text O

tools O
. O

This O
allows O
modeling O
the O
contextual O
dependencies O
between O
words O
, O
which O
help O
identify O
the O
meaning O
of O
queries O
in O
the O
search O
process O
. O

Thus O
, O
the O
queries O
are O
enriched O
by O
semantic O
knowledge O
, O
which O
enhances O
search O
performance O
. O

In O
this O
context O
, O
this O
paper O
describes O
a O
text O
mining O
- O
based O
approach O
for O
Arabic O
semantic O
IR O
, O
which O
considers O
senses O
of O

Experiments O
and O
results O
based O
on O
a O
standard O
Arabic O

collection O
are O
discussed O
through O

In O

On O
the O
other O

we O

The O

The O

In O

Unlike O
traditional O

our O
method O
first O
construct O
a O

combine O
all O

we O
call O
our O
algorithm O

We O
will O

In O

we O
explicitly O

the O

weights O
each O

these O

. O

Empirical O
evaluation O
shows O
that O
overall O
the O
presence O
of O
negation O
harms O
retrieval O
effectiveness O
while O
family O
history O
has O
little O
effect O
. O

We O
show O
negation O
is O
best O
handled O
by O
weighting O
negated O
content O
( O
rather O
than O
the O
common O
practise O

However O
, O
we O
also O
show O
that O
many O

the O

that O

We O
investigated O
two O
strategies O
for O
improving O
Information O
Retrieval O
thanks O
to O
incoming O
and O
outgoing O
citations O
. O

We O
first O
started O
from O
settings O
that O
worked O
last O
year O
and O
established O
a O
baseline O
. O

Then O
, O
we O
tried O
to O
rerank O
this O
run O
. O

The O
incoming O
citations’ O
strategy O
was O
to O
compute O
the O
number O
of O
incoming O
citations O
in O
PubMed O
Central O
, O
and O
to O
boost O
the O
score O
of O
the O
articles O
that O
were O
the O
most O
cited O
. O

The O
outgoing O
citations’ O
strategy O
was O
to O
promote O
the O
references O
of O
the O
retrieved O
documents O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
no O

improvement O
from O

OntoQuest O

a O

that O
mines O
the O
hospital O
data O
base O
for O
previous O
decisions O
made O
in O
cases O
similar O
to O
the O

one O
. O

For O

, O
OntoQuest O
displays O
a O
list O
of O
the O
medications O
prescribed O
to O
similar O
historical O
patients O
from O
which O
the O
physician O
may O
compare O
his O
choice O
of O
medication O
for O
the O
current O
patient O
. O

This O
information O

is O
accomplished O
using O
ontological O
queries O
. O

Unlike O
a O
regular O
database O
query O
, O
an O
ontological O
query O
is O
able O
to O
account O
for O
semantic O
similarity O
between O
patients O
. O

To O
implement O
the O
ontological O

, O
we O
propose O
a O
method O
for O
computing O
the O
ontological O
similarity O

Finally O
, O
we O
compare O
the O
OntoQuest O
performance O
to O
conventional O
database O

We O
believe O
that O
OntoQuest O

In O

we O
concern O

the O

how O
to O
exploit O
it O
in O

Specifically O
, O
we O
first O
propose O
a O
method O
to O
automatically O
detect O
the O

to O
translate O

Then O
, O
we O
describe O
an O

the O

a O

Finally O

are O
as O

We O
present O
an O
approach O
to O
information O

based O
on O
context O
distance O

Context O
distance O
is O
a O
measure O
we O
use O

the O

This O
context O

measures O

the O

the O
set O

We O
also O
propose O
to O
integrate O
the O
context O

morphological O
analysis O

Several O
methods O
have O
been O
proposed O
to O
evaluate O
queries O
over O
a O
native O
XML O
DBMS O
, O
where O
the O
queries O
specify O
both O
path O
and O
keyword O
constraints O
. O

These O
broadly O
consist O
of O
graph O

optimized O
with O
auxiliary O
structures O
known O
as O

indexes O

and O
approaches O

We O
propose O
a O
strategy O
that O
combines O
the O
two O
forms O

auxiliary O
indexes O
, O
and O
a O
query O
evaluation O
algorithm O
for O
branching O
path O
expressions O
based O
on O
this O
strategy O
. O

Our O
technique O
is O

and O
applicable O
for O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
choices O
of O
structure O
indexes O
and O
inverted O
list O

Our O

over O
the O
Niagara O
XML O
DBMS O
show O
the O
benefit O
of O
integrating O
the O
two O
forms O
of O

We O
also O
consider O
algorithmic O
issues O
in O
evaluating O
path O

when O
the O

This O

a O

Two O
types O
of O
data O
are O
used O
in O
pattern O
recognition O
, O
object O
and O
relational O
data O
. O

Object O
data O
is O
the O
most O
common O
type O
of O
data O
and O
is O
in O
the O
form O
of O
the O
usual O
data O
set O
of O
feature O
vectors O
. O

Relational O
data O
is O
less O
common O
than O
object O
data O
and O
consists O
of O
the O
pairwise O
relations O
( O
similarities O
or O
dissimilarities O
) O
between O
each O
pair O
of O
implicit O
objects O
. O

Such O
a O
relation O
is O
usually O
stored O
in O
a O
relation O
matrix O
and O
no O
other O
knowledge O
is O
available O
about O
the O
objects O
being O
clustered O
. O

Because O
relational O
data O
is O
less O
common O
than O
object O
data O
, O
relational O
pattern O
recognition O
methods O
are O
not O
as O
well O
developed O
as O
their O
object O
counterparts O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
area O
of O
robust O
clustering O
. O

However O
, O
relational O
methods O
are O
becoming O
a O
necessity O
as O
relational O
data O
becomes O
more O
and O
more O
common O
. O

For O

, O
information O
retrieval O

are O
all O
applications O
which O
could O
greatly O

In O

This O
paper O
proposes O
an O
incremental O
method O
that O
can O
be O
used O
by O
an O
intelligent O

to O
learn O

The O
method O
starts O
with O
a O
small O
number O
of O
terms O
selected O
from O
a O
simple O
description O
of O
the O
topic O
under O
analysis O
and O
uses O
this O
description O
as O
the O
initial O
search O
context O
. O

Using O
these O
terms O
, O
a O
set O
of O
queries O
are O
built O
and O
submitted O
to O
a O
search O
engine O
. O

New O
documents O
and O
terms O
are O
used O
to O
refine O
the O
learned O
vocabulary O

on O
a O

number O
of O
topics O
indicate O
that O
the O
learned O
vocabulary O
is O
much O
more O
effective O
than O
the O
original O
one O
at O

The O

This O

When O

( O
i.e O

Successful O

tend O

have O
a O

tend O

we O
introduce O
a O
geometric O
linear O
model O

We O
then O
apply O
the O
model O
to O
predict O
the O

The O

Although O
the O

Our O

the O

that O

We O

The O

the O

the O

This O

The O

a O

With O

The O

Word O

These O

show O
that O

In O

we O
introduce O

then O
apply O

The O

a O

Research O

Several O

We O

an O

This O
paper O
addresses O
the O
problems O
that O
lawyers O
experience O
retrieving O

Traditional O
access O
mechanisms O
of O

require O
users O
to O
know O
how O
information O
is O
stored O
. O

I O
will O
propose O
a O
method O
for O
index O
organisation O
which O
shields O
lawyers O
from O
the O
internal O

structures O
and O
which O
allows O
them O
to O
address O
the O
legal O

The O
proposed O
index O
is O
based O
on O
a O
model O
of O
legal O
tasks O
as O
opposed O
to O
traditional O
database O

Retrieval O

the O
focus O

solve O
the O

Formulating O
unambiguous O
queries O
in O
the O
Semantic O
Web O
applications O
is O
a O
challenging O
task O
for O
users O
. O

This O
paper O
presents O
a O
new O
approach O
in O
guiding O
users O
to O
generate O
clear O
requests O
based O
on O
their O
common O
nature O
of O
querying O
for O
information O
. O

The O
approach O
known O
as O
the O
“ O
front O
- O
end O
approach O
” O
gives O
users O
an O
overview O
about O
the O
system O
data O
through O
a O
“ O
virtual O
data O
component O
” O
which O
stores O
the O
extracted O
metadata O
of O
the O
data O
storage O
sources O
in O
the O
form O
of O
an O
ontology O
. O

This O
approach O
reduces O
the O
ambiguities O
in O
users’ O
requests O
at O
very O
early O
stage O
; O
and O
allows O
the O
query O
refinement O
process O
to O
easily O
to O
fulfill O
users O
’s O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
approach O
provide O
a O
powerful O

called O
“ O

query O

Separating O
singing O
voice O
from O
music O
accompaniment O
is O
very O
useful O
in O
many O
applications O
, O
such O
as O
lyrics O
recognition O
and O
alignment O
, O
singer O
identification O
, O
and O
music O
information O
retrieval O
. O

Although O
speech O
separation O
has O
been O
extensively O
studied O
for O
decades O
, O
singing O
voice O
separation O
has O
been O
little O
investigated O
. O

We O
propose O
a O
system O
to O
separate O
singing O
voice O
from O
music O
accompaniment O
for O
monaural O
recordings O
. O

Our O
system O
consists O
of O
three O
stages O
. O

The O
singing O
voice O
detection O
stage O
partitions O
and O
classifies O
an O
input O
into O
vocal O
and O
nonvocal O
portions O
. O

For O
vocal O
portions O
, O
the O
predominant O
pitch O
detection O
stage O
detects O
the O
pitch O
of O
the O
singing O
voice O
and O
then O
the O
separation O
stage O
uses O
the O
detected O
pitch O
to O
group O
the O
time O
- O
frequency O
segments O
of O
the O
singing O
voice O
. O

Quantitative O
results O
show O
that O
the O
system O
performs O
the O
separation O
task O
successfully O

we O

the O

of O

system O
, O
by O
simulating O
a O

The O
results O
show O
that O
the O
use O
of O
a O
switched O
network O
improves O
the O
performance O
, O
especially O
in O
a O
replicated O
system O
because O
the O
switched O
network O
prevents O

the O

We O
have O
constructed O
a O

The O

has O
been O

first O
one O

Today O

XML O
is O
used O
in O
three O
different O
ways O
. O

First O
, O
XML O
is O
used O
as O
a O
markup O

, O
where O
documents O
are O
considered O
to O
be O
trees O
( O

the O
occasional O

) O
which O
represent O
the O
document O
structure O
. O

Secondly O
, O
XML O
is O
used O
as O
an O
interchange O
format O
for O
structured O
data O
. O

Here O
, O
a O
document O
is O
considered O
as O
a O
set O
of O
fields O
, O
each O
of O
which O
has O
a O
specific O
data O
type O
. O

The O
third O
aspect O
is O
to O
use O
XML O
to O
represent O
text O
, O
where O
a O
document O
consists O
of O
words O
which O
can O
be O
stemmed O
and O
phrases O
and O
the O
like O
. O

Obviously O
, O
a O
single O
XML O
document O
may O
represent O
more O
than O
one O
of O
these O
aspects O
, O
so O
for O

XML O
we O
need O
a O
query O
language O
which O
takes O

all O
these O
aspects O

Therefore O
, O
understanding O

Using O

a O

This O

In O
the O

two O

the O

both O
of O
them O
are O
aimed O
at O
tuning O

on O
a O
set O

. O

The O
first O
approach O
is O
via O
a O

optimizing O

the O
second O
one O
is O
via O

We O
also O
extend O
the O

We O
show O
that O
these O

are O
due O
both O

This O

the O
knowledge O
involved O
in O
the O
HealthAgents O

Our O
work O
is O
motivated O
by O
the O
complexity O

a O

We O

conceptualises O
the O

information O
and O
propose O

This O
allows O

the O

The O
novelty O
of O
our O

lies O
in O
the O
ease O
with O
which O

Practical O
information O

the O

When O

solve O
the O

problems O
he O
encountered O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
consider O
the O
possibility O
for O
the O
user O
to O
store O

In O
this O
case O
, O
he O
will O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
retrieve O
the O
documents O
of O
interest O
more O
easily O
and O
quickly O
. O

It O
may O
also O
be O
the O
case O
that O
the O
user O
has O
not O
a O
clear O
understanding O
of O
what O
he O
is O
looking O
for O
. O

Moreover O
, O
he O
might O
not O

the O

, O
he O

It O

Information O
Retrieval O
systems O
normally O

The O
correct O
conversion O
of O
these O

is O
not O
a O

task O
since O

this O

a O

drawback O
when O
the O

since O

whether O

The O

The O
debate O
on O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
ontology O
in O
solving O
semantic O
problems O
has O
increased O
recently O
in O
many O
domains O
of O
information O

One O
side O
of O
the O
debate O
accepts O
the O
inclusion O
of O
ontology O
as O
a O
suitable O
solution O
. O

The O
other O
side O

the O
debate O
argues O
that O
ontology O
is O
far O
from O
an O

the O

This O

this O

Several O
past O
approaches O
were O
explored O

a O

investigated O
to O
test O
the O

WordNet O

The O

that O
WordNet O
is O

several O

been O

an O
individual O

We O

situation O
is O
not O
merely O
an O
individual O
effort O

inherently O
involves O
various O

We O

a O
real O

To O

we O
collected O
a O

from O

A O

the O
advantage O

an O

Recently O

The O
main O
question O
we O
address O
in O
this O

is O
whether O
sampling O

produce O
any O

the O
two O

We O

BACKGROUND O
CISMeF O
is O
a O
French O
quality O
- O
controlled O
health O
gateway O
that O
uses O
the O
MeSH O
thesaurus O
. O

We O
introduced O
two O
new O
concepts O
, O
metaterms O
( O
medical O
specialty O
which O
has O
semantic O
links O
with O
one O
or O
more O
MeSH O
terms O
, O
subheadings O
and O
resource O
types O
) O
and O
resource O
types O
. O

OBJECTIVE O
Evaluate O
precision O
and O
recall O
of O
metaterms O
. O

METHODS O
We O
created O
16 O
pairs O
of O
queries O
. O

Each O
pair O
concerned O
the O
same O
topic O
, O
but O
one O
used O
metaterms O
and O
one O
MeSH O
terms O
. O

To O
assess O
precision O
, O
each O
document O
retrieved O
by O
the O
query O
was O
classified O
as O
irrelevant O
, O
partly O
relevant O
or O
fully O
relevant O
. O

The O
16 O
queries O
yielded O
943 O
documents O
for O
metaterm O
queries O
and O
139 O
for O
MeSH O
term O
queries O
. O

The O
recall O
of O
MeSH O
term O
queries O
was O
0.44 O
( O
compared O
to O
1 O
for O
metaterm O
queries O
) O
and O
the O
precision O
were O
identical O
for O
MeSH O
term O
and O
metaterm O
queries O
. O

Metaconcept O
such O
as O
CISMeF O
metaterms O
allows O
a O
better O
recall O
with O
a O
similar O
precision O
that O

We O
propose O
a O
method O
for O
recognizing O
such O
event O

as O
“ O

” O
using O

original O

, O
and O
feed O
them O
to O
our O

effectively O
exploit O
the O
